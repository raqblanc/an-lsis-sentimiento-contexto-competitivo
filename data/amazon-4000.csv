"Loves the song, so he really couldn't wait to play this. A little less interesting for him so he doesn't play long, but he is almost 3 and likes to play the older games, but really cute for a younger child.",3
"Oh, how my little grandson loves this app. He's always asking for ""Monkey."" Grandma has tired of it long before he has. Finding the items on each page that he can touch and activate is endlessly entertaining for him, at least for now. Well worth the $.99.",5
"I found this at a perfect time since my daughter's favorite song at the moment is five little monkeys. It's easy for little ones to operate and fun with all the things you can play with. The different generes are nice too, gives its a little variety.  Worth the money. Highly recommended!",5
My 1 year old goes back to this game over and over again.  It is simple but very easy for a toddler to use.  I've even caught my 5 year old playing it as well.  Good app for little guys!,5
"There are three different versions of the song. The game itself keeps her occupied as everything she clicks on does something! There is an airplane that flies around the room, a telephone that rings and is plays a message, the lamp turns off the light and you see the monkeys eyes going up and down in the dark, a dog that barks when you click the window and then chases a cat out from under the bed every third time, the picture on the wall becomes an interactive portrait, the traffic light stops/starts the monkeys jumping, alarm clock rings, plant grows (and produces bananas), ball bounces, toy truck rumbles and honks.... lots to keep a toddler occupied! Oh! The monkeys jump on and fall off the bed! Mama calls the doctor, etc! It's great.",5
THis is just so cute and a great app for little ones. My 16 mo old loves it. She thinks it's so funny and gets a kick out of the song.,5
I watch my great grandson 4 days a week and it's hard to keep a 16 month old occupied but all I have to do is turn on Five Little Monkeys and he goes crazy trying to get the monkey's off the bed and touching all the other interactive things on the screen. I love this! I absolutely recommend this!,5
"This app is wild and crazy.  Little ones love singing the song about Five Little Monkeys, in this app it is available in country, rock or pop.  It is full of action with the player controlling most of it but it has a lesson included.",5
"love love love this app. I was going through different apps for my son and I came across this one and I was excited and singing along to the song, only problem is that the song is very quite",5
"Very cute, with alot of items to move about.  Would be awesome if the &#34;dr. said&#34;  was in a different voice and moved too.",5
WELL THE CHILDREN LOVE IT AFTER AWHILE YOU GET TIERD OF IT BUT AS LONG AS THE GRANDCHILDREN LIKE IT YOU LISTEN TO IT,4
"I got this app because my 2 year old daughter loves the song. I found that the audio could have been clearer. They also could have had better or more tune options, they only offered 'rock', country', and 'pop', which I thought were horrible for this children's song. I do like that it's interactive. Everything you touch in the room does something different. Phone rings, dog chases the cat, door opens, clock goes off, etc.....neat. My daughter also enjoys all the other interactive features it has other than the monkeys falling off the bed. &#34;Wheels on the bus&#34; app by &#34;duck duck moose&#34; ranks higher because you have much more options like changing the language, gender voice options, instrumental, and self record which my daughter finds hilarious when she hears her own voice.  Overall it's ok and she likes to see the monkeys fall off the bed.",3
My three year old Plays this game the most he loves being able to touch all the different things and watch what happens. Keeps him busy for hours,5
"Good for little ones, especially if  know the nursery rhyme.  Once you show them what to click on they pick it up fast.",3
My two year old grandson loves this game and plays it constantly !!  Keeps him busy for quite some time.,5
My granddaughter really loves this. She will listen to all 3 types of music with it and is not yet tired of it.,5
"love it, but wish it was fullscreen on honeycomb. the songs and animations are quite catchy. great for any preschool teacher or parent of you guns.",4
does not let you sample only for a sec. if you download  it to computer it talk your music you have try to sell it back to too. if you join with a membership and if you don't pay they  sell your music on your computer . how when you combine your to there player . i know cause the did it to me had rhapsody a long time unit  it happen i close the account . don't mine paying. but not for music i have  before that . had the old look . at the time now it worse,1
this is a very good app and it you need this service then this is the app for you to enjoy.,5
"It's easy to use and transfer songs. If I purchase songs I usually use iTunes but Rhapsody allows me to get songs and listen to them before I purchase them. However, some albums are only allowed to be purchased which I find annoying. I think they need to allow subscribers to get them for the fee. After all we can not keep them if we are not subscribers.",4
"Great selections.  Easy to use interface.  I have playlists for everyone in the family (me, hubby, and 10 year old son).  Works great on the PC and my MP3 players (no Apple products tested).  Also use with Sonos and that interface is also simple to use.Only complaint is that you can't customize your plan.  I want 2 MP3 players and I'd have to pay for 3.  It's an extra $70 a year.  I would only pay $2 a month for the second player, so I got a huge capacity MP3 and share.  Easy to do with playlists.",4
"I really don't think I could live without Rhapsody. I have it on my phone, my computer and my Kindle Fire. I use it everyday, no matter what device it is on, it works great. It is a wonderful way to take your favorite music and playlists with you wherever you go, whatever you do. Be aware that you do have to have a subscription and I'm pretty sure the price can range from $10 and up per month.",5
"I love this app!! Yes,after 14 days you have to pay $9.99 a month....but this app has helped keep my sanity. It is the first app that Amazon has put out for music that I have liked. I  have tried over 100 apps. from Amazon and they asked for my opinion....here it is.Rhaspody has an extremely large array of music.I had no problem finding all the different artists and albums that I love. You can even download music to play off- line . I can listen to my music all day and night long.Please get this app....you,ll love it!",5
If you pay for the subscription then by all meens get this App. It works well and  I love the service. I have a family of 4 and we all use it under one price.,5
"Tried to run this on my Kindle Fire; kept giving me message that I needed an updated flash player. When I tried to download, there were several selections, but none seemed to match my Kindle Fire settings and the ones I tried to download, didn't make Rhapsody work either. There seemed to be two ways to access Rhapsody; one took me to all this problem of the download and the other was the pay for it monthly option. I deleted all the downloads & Rhapsody app off my Kindle.",1
We love Rhapsody we use it all the time. Affordable and we can have it on 3 devices at once. We are so done wasting money on our itunes acct.5 stars all the way,5
"It just doesn't do what I needed it to do.  For someone else maybe, but I get lost in my own house LOL.",1
"I Have to Say that of All of the Many Other Music Player Apps.Around,(This 1 has the Best Overall Selection of All)!!!If you like Obscure Stuff Especially!!!!",5
"I have been a Rhapsody susbscriber for many years.  The service has been reliable and a good value, but the latest smartphone and tablet apps take it to a new level.  The UI is much improved, intuative, and brings recommendations and new releases once available only on the desktop software.  Good work!",5
"I have used most every subscription music service and when it comes to their apps, Rhapsody's offers one of the best experiences. While Spotify revolves heavily around playlists and radio, Rhapsody has both and a whole lot more. It is much easier to navigate and find the music you are looking for and it includes easy access to your saved music library. Plus you can download individual tracks, albums, and playlists for offline play. Both the interface and visual appearance are very nice. The sound quality tops out at 192 kbps AAC+, which is not as high as some services, but sounds great from my experience. There is a lower setting if you need to save data usage. Any song in their library can be listened to on-demand (or as part of a playlist or radio station) through their app. All ad-free.The service itself requires a subscription, currently $10 per month. While they do have free trials, they do not currently have a free version of the service. So if you are not interested in subscribing or giving it a trial run, then this app is probably not for you.I use this app on my first generation Kindle Fire and so far no complaints.",5
I have been a therapist fan for years. it' s a great product. download as many songs as you want each month. super quick and easy. affordable.,5
I love my rhapsody!! I was so glad that I could get it on my kindle for my daughter!! I have had Rhapsody since it was Napster...love that it is a device that we can use it on!,4
this app I do not use. and not sure how to get rid of it so I am stuck with it,5
"I did the 7-day trial and was impressed, but am continuing my search for the best music app. Pros: tons of selection (but every music app has that); my account worked on the phone and online (at least for the trial; not sure if that applies afterwards); download to play off-line (while you have the service, obviously); decent UI (I made the buttons larger for in-car use); decent arrangement of genres with descriptions, key artists, key albums, key songs; info about artists is reasonably detailed; radio stations (though lots of music apps have those); tracking of songs played (though that seemed to be online only); recommendations are ok. Cons: songs did lots of skipping/jumping, even when I had 4 bars & 4G, and even online (though songs sometimes continued when coverage was bad); lacks the customization of thumbs up/down that I grew used to in Pandora; playlist UI isn't helpful - it shows a big view of the album of the currently playing song, then the list rolls of the screen, with no view of the upcoming song (you have to scroll all the way down the list); no lockscreen control; online there doesn't appear to be a way to create shortcuts to favorite radio stations; no scrobbling (there are some 3d party programs for online use). Will continue checking out Pandora, Tunewiki (really like the sync'd lyrics, when it works), Slacker, Winamp, Rdio, etc.",3
I use this app so much at work and at home. Just find my favorite artist of the day and play their music while I work!,5
"Rhapsody is great if you like ""All you can Eat"" music..  There are a lot of music programs and services out there now but I always come back to Rhapsody for a couple reasons.1.) I love their desktop app!!2.) I love being able to use the service with a REAL mp3 player, not just an android phone or ipod touch/iphone.  With the desktop app, the service works with Sandisk MP3 Players (Most are supported but check rhapsody before you purchase one)Now for this app.  The app on android and Kindle is great.  It gives you access, not just to their radio feature, but also to their ""all you can eat"" music service.  You can download the tracks to your phone for free (As long as you keep paying the monthly fee, these songs stay active"".  Their ""radio"" feature is great if you like services like Pandora.  The Rhapsody radio doesn't have the ads like Pandora and other free radio services.  The radio feature is also very smart just like Pandora (Though I would say it is not as smart as Pandora).Overall this is a great app if you like music and like being able to choose what songs you want to listen to or if you wanna listen to an entire album!!  And the app doesn't bog the phone down with adds or video adds like Pandora!Try it for a month!! Most new phones and kindles will give you a free trial! If not you can use this link for one.. I was one over with the free trial I received when I downloaded this app to my Kindle[...]",5
"Awesome choice of music, but I can't have my kindle and my phone signed up together, even though you can have up to 3 computers, which sucks. And I can't find the music I've downloaded anywhere in my device.",4
It allows me to access Rhapsody on my Kindle which I would not be able to do without the app.,5
"I have been a subscriber to Rhapsody for more than 5 years.  The selection of music in the genres that I like to choose from is adequate...nothing great!!!  I only stay with them because I need to update the license every 30 days or so in order to listen to the music I have downloaded to my MP3 player.  But I am giving serious consideration to going to an alternative music source.  Reason you asked...the software is very &#34;unstable&#34; in my opinion.  It frequently locks up at the most inopportune times.  Obviously, this requires restarting the software program and reloading what I had already begun.  It happens so often, that it has become a pain in the backside.At this point, I would not be strongly recommending Rhapsody to others.",3
I love rhapsody. I always used it to listen to music or find new songs to download on my devices.,5
Apparently my home subscription of Real Player wasn't good enough to stream on my Android device.  Required subscription upgrade (similar to Sirius/XM),2
"You cant use this unless you have a PAID account. and if you do, it can only go to 3 computers/kindles (whatever). anymore you will exceed your limit. THIS STINKS",1
"I love it, it works great as a mobile radio app. I've been able to use Rhapsody for a year and the product and app are defiantly recommended.",4
Ipad and Ipod Touch versions are much better. App can be hard to navigate at times and seems more like a mobile site than a convenient app.,3
why would you want to get a free app and but then have to pay 10 bucks a month to use it?,1
"No matter what kind of music I want to listen to, its there! I even get a guided meditations anytime I want! Its unlimited!",5
I love Rhapsody but it costs additionally a monthly fee in order to use your rhapsody account on an android tablet. Unless you are constantly on your tablet I don't think this is worth the cost.,3
You have to go onto a computer to sign up. Well I don't own a computer!Make it so you can sign up in the app,2
wanted to find a music app that was free this one was not and was way too much money for what I was looking for.,1
"I had Rhapsody acct. on my computer before I bought my Kindle Fire.  It os very easy to use to find songs, vocal groups, or genres of music and the dowhloads are fast and easy to transfer to mp3 players or the Kindle Fire.",5
Greatest hits and win the strength slots with Elvis Presley slots are greatest so much a hit with slotomania. So keep it the higher rating.,5
"Have been using it for years, millions of choices to choose from.  Easy program interface to use.  Audio quality is great.",5
"is the music I like, non-commercial, so I recommend it, every day my daughters and I heard music, they doing their homework and I cleaning my house and the songs are our inspiraton, thank you",5
Love that I can type any song in and it comes up quick. Better than Pandora.,5
I had Napster before it changed to Rhapsody. I love Napster. being to listen to any music genre I'm in the mood for no matter where I am.I would recommend this product to anyone who likes music. The monthly plans are also very reasonable.,5
"I happen to like the country genre, and the music sounds are unbeatable! I believe this would true with any genre that you  might like!",5
"If only the software was better.As said, the service is amazing.  Competitors like Zune and Qriocity don't have a library anywhere near as deep as Rhapsody's.  But Rhapsody front ends on the Droid and the PC are sub-par.  The latest app update is better than the previous, but its still butt-ugly, and getting around feels harder than it needs to be.  They've added hi-def streaming to the latest version, and it sounds great.  A track still occassionaly drops, but I'm getting fewer of them now.Someone said that you need a higher priced subscription to use the PC software.  This isn't true, my 9.99/month subscription allows me to use the software on one mobile device and 3 PC's.But as far as the PC software goes, its simply awful.  Its supposed to handle downloads and transfers to your mobile device for offline listening, but I can't get it to work properly with my phone.  Its also hideously ugly (think old school Itunes).  Windows doesn't look like apple, so don't make an app that poorly emulates the look of an app that's already ugly.Great service...just wish they'd write better software, and hire someone who wasn't colorblind to build the interfaces.  Black and blue and gray...no real polish.Easy 5-stars if they bring their interfaces into the modern age, and make the PC version work right.  I've figured out how to download stuff to my phone for offline listening without the PC client, but a functioning client would make this so much more pleasant.They've released a web beta that looks pretty darn sharp--hoping they'll bring its look and feel down to the PC and Android soon and move the button/menu options around so I have less mis-taps.",3
I got a new Kindle and quickly started downloading a bunch of apps and books.  I downloaded this app and realized it wasn&#8217;t for me.  It bored me very quickly.  I downloaded the important ones from Amazon&#8217;s library and am content with what I have.  Not for me&#8230;but maybe you&#8217;ll like it.,3
I like it cause the music can be saved and stored in rhapsody song match and if you have an account with them your music is automatically saved.,5
I love Rhapsody and have it on my home computer.  But this AP wanted me to pay for a second membership for it. I deleted it from my kindle,1
"Excellent source for music if your  willing to pay for the service.  If you're looking for music give it a try, they give you a free trail. If you don't like it you can always look elsewhere.",4
"This app is a widget on Android devices; works as an app on the Fire.  Easy to use, and provide reviews and information about the artists you listen to.",4
"Went looking for a app to listen to tunes on my Kindle fire.Tried a few free app,not my cup of tea).Like this 1 cause I don't have to take up a lot of space on my device.",5
This simply is the best app for music. $10 is a great price to get all of your favorite songs classic and modern. Don't go anywhere else. Falsify is the best,5
This app was a free trial for a certain amount of time. I used it daily when I downloaded it.  I enjoyed being able to listen to any song I was in the mood for.,5
For those of you who already have a Rhapsody subscription this is a good app to get.  As long as you can connect to the internet you can listen to your music without filling your devices storage space.  The interface is simple to use.  It needs a graphic equalizer and at nothing you can&#8217;t beat the price.,3
"Works great!  Sign in once and get most of your music at your fingertips!  Not all music is readily available, but most is right there!",5
"Rhapsody it great to have on your tablet or computer. Great music with famous artists and songs for free and you also can upgrade to avoid ads,but for me  its ok with the ads for free.",5
"I have used this music source for a number of years and overall, they have a good variety ranging from Jack Hylton to Frank Sinatra to Black Ghosts. The only problem I had is that I had to keep the Caffine app on in order to get more than 30 seconds of a song which I found a little frustrating.  Still, a great way to hear some music from yesteryear and expand on your interests!",4
"I've been using Rhapsody since the former Yahoo Music days.  The app for Kindle works great, just like the apps for the other Android devices.",5
I just wanted a music player for what I already own.  This charges you to listen to music that is provided.  Dev needs to be more clear about this.,1
I know this app has been out for a while but I just downloaded it.  It's easy to use I just have to remember that I have it on my kindle.  I can get used to it though.  And it's free.,4
We can't get enough of Rhapsody! I play it everyday for the entire house as we work and play. It is amazing!,5
"was a Napster subscriber when it joined rhapsody, now can finally use the service on my fire! there was no Napster app for the fire. anyhow,  great interface and music streams nice and clear!",5
can download all the songs i like and it is easy as pie!! my son got me interested and am so glad he did. Will continue to use this app!!,5
"Soo much easier than downloading music. I don't care about the 10 bux a month subscription. I get to listen to anything from comedy cd's by kevin hart, wheels on the bus for my son or the first beastie boys cd. It has everything.",5
I have been a member of Rhapsody now for &#34;years&#34; ! I believe as for a recommondation &#34;years should say it all&#34;,5
I love Rhapsody especially the updated version. My whole family uses it. We have it on all our gadgets. recommended,5
This application simply did not work the way I thought it ought to work. When I loaded the app on my device I thought I would be able to load selected tunes from my PC library to this. Instead the app displayed a mind of its own and loaded songs at random. Not at all user friendly.,1
This is  a great! It pops up and you can devotions from a number  of people! but nothing is better that The scriptures daily!,5
The best part of this app is that you can listen to free podcasts or sermons. I love hearing Joel Osteen so this is my fav feature.,5
Every morning I wake up to an inspirational bible verse. It helps me clear my mind before a long day. I can save the verses also if I want to refer back to them in troubling times. It even works without an internet connection somehow. I was on a cruise with no internet or mobile data and i STILL received my verses. Such a blessing!,5
It is so nice to have the Bible at your disposal. I love the reading plans and well as the fact that it can be read to you.,5
Remove,5
Wish that It was easier to navigate in but for the most part a great app for the Bible.  Praise God,4
"Clean, simple, easy to use. Daily verse, choice of Bible version, devotionals and pod casts. Would recommend to anyone! A real blessing!",5
I first downloaded it on my cell phone. Enjoyed it so much I've recently downloaded it on my Kindle. I enjoy the daily verse as well as the other features it offers.,5
I wish this had more versions. I love the daily verses and the ease of checking it but I like more background and history on the Word.,3
I downloaded the bible app for my kindle fire and I also have it on my phone. The app is so great! I dont have any problems with anything. I love listening to the podcast. Joyce Meyer is my favorite.,5
I enjoy my Daily Bible as I enjoy reading a verse when I firstopen my cell phone in the morning.  I find it very inspirational.,5
"Thank you for the DAILY BIBLE, JoanSoft.....  I now start my day with listening to the DailyVerse.  I am a religious person but not to the extreme.  Listening to the DailyVerse reminds me of my days in grade school when we started the day off by reading from the Bible. It didn't hurt anyone and I know it helped me.  Thanks again for a great app.",5
"Great app. I enjoy seeing the random daily verses.  The podcasts are the best.  One of my favorite evangelists, Joyce Meyer, is on there.",5
Very versatile app for daily reading of the bible.  Different reading plans offered.  Helps me work on my daily reading.  I like the fact that I don't have to carry around a paper copy book!,5
unless you are connected you will not be able to read the Bible. I did like the daily verse of the day. There are also many different versions of the bible that you can choose to read from when you are connected to the internet.,3
"This app is great!  It has a daily verse, a daily reading plan and then a whole list of daily devotionals, both audio and written.  I usually check out the Our Daily Bread audio podcast from here instead of going to odb.org and read My Utmost for His Highest (no longer available! :-( But still appears in list for some reason).  There is also a place to seach the bible by verse or keyword.  Many of the popular versions are available including NIV, NKJV and NASB.  Is exactly what is says... a Daily Bible!  Thanks for this app!",5
I am able to share and send devotions to my friends of many different speakers. Also you can find many different types of devotions with different versions of the Bible. Love it.,5
"What a refreshingly wonderful app. There is so much content out there that to have it all mailed to me would be overwhelming. Thanks to these wonderful people I have been able to expand my spiritual walk to measures unknown to me. My eyes have been opened to revelations and deep understanding that otherwise I had been ignorant to. By having and using this app my daily morning study gets me ready for the day and keeps my heart in tune with God.It is customizable to which content I decide to read and listen to. Because of the audio portion my spiritual walk has encountered a new path of what can only be described as an old friend. That is how he will make you feel after just a short listen. I am talking about Pastor McGee and his TTB Bible radio program. It is a five year journey through the entire Bible and no one has been able to explain it as he has.McGee has a unique view into the word of God and looking back he was indeed at the beginning movement of the Christian non denominational faith. He saw the way had been opened and how chains of hierarchy and rules of the old establishment were being abandoned.He is only one of many podcasts that are available, from daily to old sermons to modern convention speeches. Rick Warren has a spot there as well as Joyce Meyers and so many others.Daily reading plans and so many wonderful features.I have gained so much for so long that some time back I became a regular supporter  of their ministry for it is with these works that many are being baptized in the Holy Spirit.",5
"This isn't a bad ap, but I prefer Our Daily Bread and Daily Bible Devotion better.  I do read it once in a while.",3
This app is a really worth getting if you love the Bible as I do.  It has a lot of great features.,5
"ONLY i wish it was in other versions, like the ESV, and the NKJV ~ but this is a great study/read!",5
It gives you an update everyday on any verse it's kinda like the verse of the day.If you want it to read to you it will.If you get distracted a lot just  put in your ear-buds and listen to it.,4
It is good but I was looking for more.I could be what you need so give it a try.,3
"I mostly listen to the scripture for the day.  Sometimes experience difficuly with podcasts.  Good source of reference. Pop ups to get more out of the app, can be a little annoying.",3
"This is a great app for daily scriptures, the bible on the go, and inspiring podcasts.  There is also an audio button for those who cannot read.",5
"The daily Bible by joansoft is hands down the best daily Bible app on the market, ANY market. I love the fact that it is extremely easy to use. My favorite feature is the share feature allowing the user to quickly and easily share the verse of the day to any social networking site. There is quick and easy links to a whole plethora of daily devotionals helping the user to develop their walk with God on a daily basis. I love this app and I have had MANY Bible apps but none can compare to what this one offers.",5
love the daily Bible verses each morning. I don't always have time to read the Bible for my Bible study group so being able to listen to the Bible or have it at my fingertips and when I have a moment is great,4
ok I don't have this version of the Bible app. I have the you version but anyway I read the reviews and am totally shocked!! do some people really not know what the Bible is and think its fiction!!! I am totally blown away by this. God is very real and he is our savior he also gave us free will. so you are free to choose your path and what you believe. however he loves us all anyway and should you ever come to God he will welcome you with open arms. God bless,5
So far this it the best Daily Bible that I've found as a free app so far.  I've only been looking for about a week but so far I really like this one.,5
"This app has everything you need. Daily scripture, bibles, devotionals. I look forward to it every day. I like that I can set it to come on automatically every morning.",5
I really love everything about this app.  I use it all of the time.  It gives you total access to the Bible.  Works great on the Kindle Fire.  I'm spoiled.  I'd be lost without it!!!!!  I mean that.,5
"Works for the most part if you're reading, but I like to listen to the Bible while driving.  It's nice that it even has audio because none of the other free bible apps I know of offer that.  My only beef is that sometimes the audio works, and sometimes it doesn't.  I guess it's not the app's fault.  Probably has something to do with the Sprint cellular network I'm on.  I would have preferred to have an option to save the files on my phone as opposed to getting them off the web every time I open it.  That way I'd have instant access to it.  I gave three stars however because despite its problems, the price is right.",3
This app gives me the motivation needed to meet the day.  A reading from the Good Book always puts me in the proper mind set.,5
Great app for Christians. You will enjoy this app and enjoy the choices you have. One of my favorites! I love this app.,5
"I am using this app as part of my morning devotionals.  Perfect combination of verse, daily Bible reading, and devotional.  I have others I do, but save this for the last one as I really enjoy it!",5
best biible app ever hay finallyvvvhhhjhhjjnnn b b b b b b b b b bjbbnbn nbn. n. Nb. j. b,5
I use a different bible for scriptures. However this one has insightful scriptures for my wife and I to talk about and the daily plan that we can read during the day and talk about later. this app has helped is to be more insistent with reading the bible and praying together.,5
This App is important to me because I can cross references it with my study Bible. It is a great App.,5
The Daily bible give me a verse to read and easy way to get to other chapters and verses.  It even let me read different bible version.,5
There's Always Time for the Daily Bible.  I like this product because it's right there at your finger tips. Great!,5
"This app was actually very stupid and very boring.  Unless I missed something, its nothing but a blank screen with one verse written down.  You can't really do to much more then read the one small passage.  I deleted it after about a week.",1
I really love this app!  It's a nice way to have a daily scripture to ponder over.  There is also the option for more in depth scripture study which I also love.  I truly look forward to checking this app daily and it has added another nice source to help grow in my faith daily.,5
"I love waking up each day to a bible verse.  You have the opportunity to save verses creating a type of ""favorite list."". You can look up verses in full context and in different Bible versions.  There are other features, and the app works great on any phone I've ever had.",5
", Also has a share info port on screen to send same to family & friends.  I love that you can read whatever version you want,The writing is easy read.. Good Job!!!",5
"I have been trying to find a really good Bible plan. Well I did.  I listen with the audio and it is fantastic.  Finally something I know I will stick to. This plan gives me devotionals, preaching and Bible reading.  I can hardly wait until tomorrow for the next reading.  :-)",5
Thank you for providing an app that not only has a daily Bible verse but other preachers as well. Thank You,5
"So many days I've been comforted and encouraged by this app! The customization options for study are terrific. If what you want is supplemental to your time in the Word, this app cannot be beaten!",5
"I get to listen to different messages from a long list of preachers from Joel Olsteen, Joyce Meyer and Creflo Dollar. It is a spiritual tool I tap into more than once a day. This app also allows me to search chapters or verse and it can be read to me which is hard to find (in a human sounding voice)  .THIS IS MY GO TO APP FOR PODCASTS.",5
Use this app nearly every day. I enjoy reading it and sometimes listening to the audio version. Handy to have many translations.,5
It's god work. enjoy not only able to read it but listen to the word too. Very good excellent book,5
My son loves this and uses it daily on his little Tablet.  He has learning Disabilities and cannot read well without the Tablet's help and he enjoys reading (or having the Bible read to him daily!,5
"I have this on both my phone and Kindle Fire HD. I use it more on my phone. It requires WiFi or Internet, which makes it more usable on my phone. I love getting the verse everyday. I can search and read devotionals as well. It is a really nice app for on the go purposes.",5
"I am busy 24/7.  I am embarrassed to admit my quite time with God at times is less than 5 minutes a morning.  On those days this app comes in handy.  Also, some days I need a pick-me-up and this works every time.  I like how I can choose the version (NIV KJ NKJ etc)",5
"What a great blessing to have this to read each morning, each and everyday Gods Word right on my kindle, and different versions great work, t hank you thank you!!!",5
"I didn't like that you could select a version for you daily verse, but the daily reading defaults back to ESV, and you can't change it. I deleted it within a few minutes",1
"This app allows you to read the Bible, receive daily devtionals, and daily scriptures in the most commonly used Bible version (atleast by me) NLT, NKJV, and KJV. You also get to listen to podcast by today's leading ministries ex: Joyce Meyer, Joel Osteen, Charles Stanley and etc.",5
I love how it reminds me every morning to read my daily verse. I really love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This Bible is made for every type of Christian.,5
"I love this app. My favorite part is getting the reminder for the daily Bible verse in the morning. I also like being able to hear the scriptures, so if I don't have time to sit and read, I can be listening to God's Word!",5
"I love this app. I have no complaints, and I didnt have any complications with this app, very easy and simple to understand. I love reading the bible where ever I go.",5
"I liked the Daily verse option.  However, the DailyPlan was hard to follow.  It does the job...I will keep it.  I am back to using my hands-on Bible though.",3
"GET THIS APP!  If you desire to gain more knowledge about the Bible and to be able to do it on a daily basis, I would highly recommend this app because it keeps you on track and you can both read and listen to it either at home or in your car.  This is an awesome app also because it has several great features that make it better than other similar apps.  Unfortunately, you can't get this app for the Apple system, but if you have a Kindle or Android you are set.  I highly recommend it!",5
"It's a good app. You do not need an internet connection to use it or to get the verse of the day, which is cool, but it would be nice if you could highlight (like you can a kindle book) but other than that, a good app.",4
I listen to this app all the time especially the devotions where you can listen to many great podcasts. It is very easy to use and recommend it highly,5
quick and easy to get to on my laptop. great for in a rush adn on the go love it,5
"I love it.  What else can I say.  Getting God's word every day, even from a tablet is the best.",5
The app is a good app however it was not good for what I needed the app for. It might wrk for other people's needs.,3
I so love this app.I have been looking for a book that will help me memorize Bible verses easily without having to look at a page full of words. I give this app 5 stars easily.,5
"I was looking for an app to help me with my annual &#34;read through the Bible in a year&#34; and this app is perfect.  I really like the way it offers several different plans (since I like to do it a different way each year).  Plus with this app there are daily messages (in your choice of lots of translations!), and practically all of it can be read aloud to you.  This is an excellent Bible app.",5
"I have this downloaded on my Kindle Fire and use it in church, it is so much easier to go to the different books of the bible",5
"There are so many different options. You can read a verse or listen to a podcast or even just read the Bible. Looking up verses is a cinch. There is also an option for audio. Great app,  just genius!!!!!",5
I like the fact that it has audio as well and that I can read the daily plan in different versions.  I recommended this to my brother who has macular degeneration in both eyes and he thoroughly enjoys it as well.,5
Great app!!!! I use it alot since I've had it..I just don't think there's any other app out there that has it all......!!!,5
This app allows you to read and listen to the word during your devotions on a daily basis. While moving around or in one place you can listen to your favorite pastor sharing messages.  Your can listen anywhere and really immerse yourself in the word so that you enhance your understanding of the bible.Don't take my word for it. Try it out yourselves.,5
This is one of the best Apps going for a daily bible guide that works well on the Kindle Fire. It is easy to start and has links that are just as easy to use for further depth if you want to pursue a topic. I really like it.,5
"I love this app. It has a lot of variety to it in the way of speakers or podcasts, scripture verses and everything.",5
this app works great. u can schedule it to give u one inspirational verse per day as well as choose what translation u want showing on the widget.,5
"Pretty good Bible app if you have internet service.  Some of the information you may need to look up May not display if you are not connected online.  This is the first Bible app I tried, it is often difficult to manipulate the search engine.I have since found a much better Bible app in my opinion and much more user friendly but maybe someone might like this better.  This app just did not work for me.",3
Getting the daily verses are good.  Some days it hits home for that day.  Being able to find verses so quickly is wonderful.  I am still a hunter for some of the books of the Bible.,5
So uplifting to get a bible verse on a daily basis.  Love the access to look up information when needed for bible study and the ability to have it read to you is a great feature.,5
I am really enjoying this app.  I like the daily plan as it covers passages from different books; also the devotional podcasts. This is my third Bible app. and I put this at the top of the list.Recommend it to everyone,5
"This app was awesome, but the Daily Plan went blank, and has not been fixed. it doesn't matter which plan you are on. I tried going to the website, but joansoft.com is totally down. Looks like the domain may have expired. Does that mean things won't get fixed? Help!",3
"very straightforward, easy to use, plus the Daily Devotion are real time and up to date.With Joyce Meyer, Joel Olsten any other . The I like is from joyce Meyer's New book God's not mad at you.",5
"I like this app.  It sends a reading to you each day, it will read the verse to you if connected.  Tabs include: Daily Plan ( various longer Bible verses that can be read to you), Devotion tab (recordings of various speaker talks on different subjects), and a final Search tab (you can enter a book, chapter and verse and it will come up).  This is a very useful and  very friendly app.",5
A Word each day from God's Word and so much more! It's free like Jesus frees a man from his sin.,5
first thing I would like to do is to thank amazon for putting the Bible and Christian readings on the amazon fire.ienjoy the daily Bible because of the daily readings. everyone should have it installed on their kindle fire .thanks Tommy adams,5
"VerseS Are Well Choosen And Mostly Just What I Need For That Day. Awesome Links To Podcasts, And A Really Good variety.",5
Downloaded to use when I go to church or Bible study. Easy to find scriptures and several version selections also,5
I love this app. It was one of the first I downloaded on my tablet. The many versions and ease of use are super. The best feature I love are the audio devotions.,5
I like this app a lot Thanks for being here.Hope it helps you as much ss it helps me.,5
"The podcast devotionals are great pick me ups, or when attending church is not an option. I also love the verse of the day part.",5
the best mobile Bible app that I could find.I love it. You can listen to a devotional.Please download it now.,5
I love that a quote from the Bible pops up everyday while I'm in the middle of doing something else. It allows me to stop and reflect on the Word.,5
I was really surprised by this product. You basically get to read a line a day and navigation is very very very very very very hard. Maybe God can figure it out.,3
"Daily Bible verse.  I love this, it pops up every morning, its searchable, and you can save your favorite verses.",5
It just helps me feel closer to the lord so I love who made this app :)thanks to God I am here today,5
didn't like this app at all I dnt receive anything I instantly uninstalled. i expected the best from this App and didn't get it,1
"I get the point of it, but its just the fact that there is no tutorial.  they tell you what to do but it is.not clear",3
"Overall, a pretty well made tower defense game. I found it to be quite fun, if a bit too easy on the easy settings.Things that aren't in the instructions that people can't seem to figure out on their own:You place power station towers to recharge your towers. 3 were sufficient for me to beat the first level.When placing a tower, you tap the location you want it, and then you can drag your finger around anywhere on the screen to fine-tune the placement. Quite brilliant, that; it solves the problem of trying to carefully place the tower while it's under your thumb.Enemies come from left to right on the first level. I assumed the opposite, due to the background graphic.Overall, a pretty solid game. Runs well, no crashes, no lockups, freezes, or any other negative events. Graphics are suitable to what you would expect from a bubble popping TD game.-1 star for poor instructions, not that it wasn't hard to figure out; very easy, simple game.EVO 3D, FAOTD.",4
this game is easy to understand its like tower defense but the controls are impossible so not worth it even as a freebie what a waste.,1
"It's a tower defense game. I like the twist of the energy towers. It doesn't have beautiful, intense graphics but doesn't need them. Most of the low ratings are from trolls or people incapable or too lazy to read the instructions. I took off one star due to price. If it hadn't been a FAOTD the current cost is too high.",4
"The towers take forever to move, the instructions are in a very inconvenient place, and the towers can't keep up with the circles. On level one in the easiest setting I got a tower and it couldn't keep up with the circles so the game is basically impossible. Uninstalled right away, not worth the money, DO NOT GET!",1
"Can only play about 5 minutes and then forces closed. It's a fun game, just frustrating that in the middle of a round, forces close. Please update and fix. Motorola Defy Android 2.2",2
this game is great now that its free and yes there are some issues that can be fixed but if you don't want to pay three bucks for it then get it while its free now.,4
I just tried this game and the towers need to recharge but I have no idea how to do that I literary tried everybutton then I even went to help and all it all it said was they will need to be recharged so I folly don't reccomend this.,1
Among the Android tower defense games this sets itself apart pretty well with the concept of power requirements and mobs that fight back but everything about this game feels like it was half assed. Not least among the issues is the horrible UI that I can safely say is the worse I have ever seen on a mobile phone game. If you got it for free from Amazon might be worth setting down with for a few minutes but I could never justify to myself spending any money for it.,2
"This app is about how people fight bubbles of water while flying in air balloons.... ? seriously this app just fails in every direction, the concept of gameplay is unappealing and shamefull, graphics sucks, and did I mention that there's no music? :D am destroying this app to rubble, 1 star for faotd again.... you mad bro? good be mad hahaha",1
"I would at least assume they had some experience with app. development considering this is the second game in a hopefully 2 part series. But it's obvious they don't learn from their mistakes.. time to stop trying, Maribou inc. I feel sorry for the poor S.O.B.s that shelled out three bucks for this.",1
"greetings fellow amazonians from here at the Nashville city holding cell. this is not where I live, but I was extradited to here because a previous public nudity charge.anywho I was here and pretty bored so I looked up the faotd. I was a little worried that bubble defense 2 was not good to download and play in jail, but boy was I wrong. even though the game is a little lame the guys here don't care. some of them have been sitting here since the first. iphone came out and didn't know that this stuff exists. what was great I could use this game as a new currency which is really making my stay here pretty nice. thanks amazon for making my stay in jail an enjoyable one!",4
"At first I  didn't  think  it was working  right on my K Fire. I couldn't  drag the towers, but once I figured out how to place them (just tap where u want them) things were fine. I only give it 4 stars because the graphics could be lots better.",4
"Never been speechless, but this is how this game leaves me unfortunately. Maybe by version 10 it will get better? I hope so.",1
"this is by far the best game on android, beats angry birds, plants &amp; zombies,any EA game, any Eloft game, cut the rope...got sarcasm?",5
"Fun game while it lasts, but it FCs all the time with no rhyme or reason on my A500.  The only saving grace is that it sort of saves your game just before it blitzes (except for the 1 time it destroyed all my towers upon reload).  If the FC gets fixed, I'll up the stars.  It's not bad enough for 1 star, but the FCs keep it a solid 2.  Other than that, it would be a 5.",2
"Touch response is nonexistent. Instructions are very little help. Good thing I got it as a free app, I would be demanding my money back with how much this game normally costs.",1
"I played the first bubble defense game from the other market, and and enjoyed it. I admit this pales in comparison to Jelly Defense, but this is a solid game.",5
"It sucks!!The weapons are stuped.Don,t wast your time and your money.Who came up with this game is stuped. Get a life.",1
"Ended up removing this game from my phone.  It wasn't fun and I couldn't figure out how to make the ""cannon"" fire more than once at a target. At least it was free.",1
"it is a tower defends game, but its basic, it doesn't tell you what each tower does, and there is no pause or restart. not bad once you know it, bit gives a terrible first impression by mot helping the player learn to play.",2
"I don't know how long I've been playing it for, but I got it as the Free App of the Day a while ago. I play it everyday, multiple times a day. Like others who have it a 1 star review I also like Jelly Defense and Plants vs Zombies; while the graphics may not be as good as those other games, I'm getting much more play time out of this. Jelly Defense took me a while to finish and was worth it (if I had paid for it, another Free App of Day), this one is taking me much much longer to finish.  I'd rather the graphics be lacking if the game can be played for many weeks, or more?I'm addicted to it. I just wish I knew a little more about how certain things work, I'm trying to figure these out. Like I recently learned upgrading the power stations is very important, not just buying more. Upgrade everything.Sometimes I notice a tower right next to a power station let all the things go by without shooting at any of them, I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong when that happens, but that's rare. Also I want to know what it means when a tower has that little power graphic flash or sometimes just stay solid. Does it mean it needs power? Like it wants to shoot but can't at the moment?So other than a wanting a few more instructions, I love the game. Even with the things I can't seem to figure out, it still gets 5 stars.I'm surprised by all the low ratings here and wonder if it's mostly people who dont like or know how to play defense games.I wish people would realize they should rate on the quality of the app, not on whether it's their type of app. The low ratings hurt the developer and cause them to sell less games.If you like defense games get it, if I was suddenly forced to pay for it now, I would definitely buy it, because after a few weeks of playing I have lots of play-time left. Actually, I think I'll end up moving on to a new game before ever finishing all these levels.",5
"unfortunately this is one of those games that was &quot;good&quot; on blackberrys because the java based crapOS ment this.game was top of the line. coming to android will be a.different story, but the game it self was fun when I played it on the storm. The closest thing I can compare it too is Bloon TD 1or2. luckly 4 is on one or more android stores. Would recomend spending 1$ on that over this anyday. To all BB devs... either step up your game or go down with the dieing BB ship.",3
Despite many of the other reviews I gave it a shot. It's pretty fun on my Kindle Fire. Don't know why so many people are being harsh. Give it a try if you like tower defense games.,4
"This is the first tower defense (TD) game i've played and it's an enjoyable game.  Most of the negatiave reviews are from people that don't understand the concept and were to lazy to try to understand...or perhaps just trolling, big surprise.  The initial towers you can purchase shoot once.  As you earn more coins you can upgrade to better towers, power stations etc.  Anyways, the game looks simple in appearance, but again it's just a simple TD game for your phone.  The two things i don't like were the instructions didn't mention that you can upgrade during waves, not just between waves.  Also, I couldn't slide towers across my screen.  I could only move them by touching the spot on my screen where i'd want them.  This was tedious at times because the tip of your finger isn't as accurate as if you were using a stylus.  Sliding would have been much easier.  HTC Thunderbolt stock.",4
"Those of you who like tower defense games are likely to enjoy games where creeps get progressively stronger, and towers that are adaptable, upgradeable and offer a variety of armaments. This app doesn't offer much - it is a clunky game that lacks finesse, especially in level and unit design.The most frustrating part is that the towers are slow. They fire a single shot, and then take forever to reload. And thats plenty of time for a herd of bubbles to go whizzing by. Not much of a defense. It takes a while to figure out that you need to build and upgrade power stations to recharge your towers so they can fire more than once. The instructions aren't too helpful, either. The touchscreen is also laggy at times, which adds to the frustration.It might be easier to just include a button that lets you wave a white flag and surrender, rather than wait patiently for inevitable annihilation.There are many better TD games out there. This one is mediocre, at best.",2
My team was on the bubble. Then Joe Lunardi popped it. Thanks a lot Joe for that. NIT here we come.,1
this game makes no sense!! the instructions are not helpful at all!  i don't know if it is fun if u do it right but this game is annoying!,1
"First, it's great news that this app by Maribou does not contain unnecessary permissions, as did another app of theirs a couple of weeks ago.  However, why this developer keeps cranking out game apps that can't be moved to the external SD card remains a mystery and a concern. Yes, it's only a MB in size, and I can fit this app and a whole team of Clydesdale horses in my phone's internals, but for some folks, this will become an issue during app ""spring cleaning,"" and apps like this will be the first to go.Second, wish I would have known the app has no sounds so I didn't have to spend time fiddling with phone settings, thinking it was my settings.Third, with all the same complaints about the power stations over at Google Market, you would think the developers would rethink the app and take them out.  They don't HAVE to -- it's THEIR game.  But if they want to make it OUR game on our devices and charge for it, they would be wise to just redesign it and give the people what they're begging for!  They should take the complaints about the towers for what they really are:  FREE development strategy advice being handed to them on a silver platter!Fourth, the gameplay.  Sadly, it is indeed laggy as many have reported, and coupled with the frustration of the towers, it's just not providing any fun.  If the towers are necessary to provide the energy, they shouldn't be so expensive.  I'm just not sure lowering their price is going to satisfy those who already have developed a distaste for their existence to begin with and, hence, not be the solution to end the complaints.Maribou may want to to take this app back to the drawing board and make these changes... or not.  Depends on whether they want to stay competitive in at least the tower defense market.  And if their ultimate goal is to have customers download multiple apps they create, then for heaven's sake -- let them go to the SD card to attract some non-rooted customers and those who are vigilant as to what they feel is necessary and important enough to take up precious phone space.",1
"Stupidest game ever!!!!! Its also terrible, not fun, dumb, and well you get my point. Don't play this game if you did uninstall now",1
"No sound, terrible concept, graphics look like an out of focus photo, and horrendously overpriced.  An insult to all video games.",1
"The one star reviews are somewhat right.  Nowhere do the instructions indicate how to get towers to fire more rapidly.  Build enough power and the game's not too bad.  The interface is still a bit clunky,  but it's not an awful game.  One bonus star for not grabbing unnecessary permissions.",3
I got the first one and this one was $ and I did not get it but theme I got it on the day it was free and I love it,5
"With such simple graphics and no sound, this is certainly overpriced at three dollars. You could get three defense games with that money and each would be better. The bubble defense is pretty standard but I just did't like this as much as most other games. Save your money.",2
"Honestly, what the hell is wrong with people today? The instructions about the power sources is *PERFECTLY* clear. Just because the bulk of the one star reviewers are brainless mouthbreathers, who are incapable of comprehending basic English, doesn't mean this is a horrible game.Idiots aside, this is actually a fun little game and, IMHO, a nice variation of your typical tower defence game. The controls aren't perfect though. Placing the towers can be a little cumbersome in terms of fine tuning the location in a hurry. So meaning that after doing the initial click-to-place the &quot;dragging&quot; for fine tuning is very slow. ESC = 'back arrow'.Game plays just fine on my rooted / rom'd Charge.",4
"This is a basic tower defense game.It's not the best looking or most advanced, but it is quite functional (at least on the kindle fire).  In my opinion - it could use better descriptions of the towers in the help menu. It's never mentioned that you NEED a power station - or your towers just shoot once...  I think the icon on a tower once it's depleted it's power does a decent job, but that kind of information is critical to gameplay and should be clearly spelled out in the instructions somewhere.I initially went to the help menu because I tried to DRAG my tower to where I wanted to.  It moved amazingly slow.  I figured that COULDN'T be how it was supposed to be.  It wasn't.  The help screen let me know to touch the location where I wanted the tower and then drag it for fine tuning (which actually works well).""ESC to cancel"" also isn't of much help on the single button kindle fire.  To cancel placing a tower on the kindle fire, hit the little arrow at the bottom of the screen that brings up your menu, then hit the ""back"" arrow.Something else I would REALLY like to see is a ""restart level"" option.  I've placed my towers wrong and I want to go back and do it all again.  I have to exit and save - go back to the main menu, choose the level, select to start fresh.  It would be a lot easier to have menu options to just start over.I like the fact that this game doesn't have crazy permission requirements - but I don't think it's a $2.99 game.",3
"this is not a good game. do not by it. I mean, really. its terrible. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!",1
"Its sad to see so many Android users turn into Elitist Apple Fanboys crying about how this app ""isn't good enough"" for their ultra high performing devices. This game runs and looks fine on my Samsung Galaxy S2 so yah, I disagree about how ""bad"" this app is. It may not be as good as other Android games, but it certainly doesn't deserve the 1-star ratings its getting.",5
"wow what a waste of time.  place the tower, dragging works like crap so you just have to touch where you want it not drag.  then when the baloons come, the towers shoot once and then have a little icon that looks like a lightning bolt and never shoot again.  worthless app that I'm glad was free... don't waste your time with it",1
"I never read game  tutorials, but maybe should have with this one.  It took me a while to realize that the easiest way to build new towers is NOT to drag them, but click the tower you want to build and then click the place on the map you want to build it.  The game itself gives you strategy tips for the game in general during the 1st level.  The only other thing you need is your brain, and it's a decent tower defense game.  The only thing that could be improved is the graphics, and a forced tutorial level that makes you place certain towers and explains what they do.",5
Dont drag just tap where you want to place. All towers have a radius so you know which ones your power station will effect!  Perfectly good tower defense game with a little common sense.,5
I spent some time playing this game to get to understand how it worked. It is a simple tower defense game and from that point of view it did what it said it would. It featured 13 different maps and it had a fast forward button to play through each attack at high speed. As long as you plant enough power towers to let your weapons fire you will have it made. You can gain enough points to update the weapons and vastly improve their power for killing the bubbles. The flying balloon weapons are nice as they can track the invaders along the route and continuously bring lethal fire down upon the bubbles. We all know air power rules the battle.I liked how the game did not ask for multiple permissions and finally someone listened to the users and stopped all of the intrusive requests.That being said I have to admit I am not much into tower defense games like this one. I played for quite a while but I just didn't find the game to be as much fun as others I have played. For me this was a 3 star game.,3
I gave this game a chance and boy was I wrong it's so stupid. I  can't believe I wasted some of my 32gb  on this game,1
"This is a fun, challenging, and, simplistic tower defense game. The graphics are lack luster, but fits the gameplay. I enjoy the depth the game has with the bubbles popping and creating additional bubbles. Reminds me of balloon pop, which is very fun. My only complaint is the ESC option to cancel laying down a tower... How do I do this?",3
"had this game on my phone for YEARS. don't judge it based on todays pretty phones. it does what it says and added another level of play from the original game. this is a great game for just wasting a bit of time and casually playing. some of us don't want games that have to be 3d or super fancy. consider this a &quot;retro&quot; game, it is 4 + years old.",4
definitely not even worth the time downloading (and it only took a few seconds to download and install on 4g!). It a really boring tower defense game with a minor twist in that you have to provide energy for all of the defensive mechanisms you put in.,1
"This is terrible! Poor graphics and concept is out there,  but really better graphica would make it allot better.  Perhaps a free app to begin with or if they need money that bad 50&cent;.  Give me a go theme, calculator, tricorder, script or something.",1
I love this game! It's my second favorite defense game next to the original (I like it better without the tower stamina). Definitely worth it and highly recommended!,5
"I liked this game just fine. I do enjoy tower defense games quite a bit, but all the other reviews had me thinking this game wad no good. I'm glad I tried it for myself, because I'm pretty addicted.",5
"Its a pretty simple looking game.  The graphics are pretty base, and, the sound is lacking, but, I like the game mechanics, and I find it to be a better than average spin on tower defense.I find this title to be above average.",4
I consider myself a TD veteran. Even on easy I feel like I'm just trying to survive even the easiest map of this game.Placing towers is awkward.Power system is intriguing but frustrating.,1
"horrible, each tower took one shot, and then stopped. not to mention when you buy the tower and try to move them it moves barely, or it skips all the way across the screen. uninstall on my galaxy s II",1
"This game works just fine! When you go to start a level there is a paragraph that says right at the end that you HAVE TO HAVE POWER STATIONS to power your towers! Otherwise, yes, they'll only shoot once. It was obvious after playing around for only 5 minutes exactly what tower did what, &amp; how well everything worked. For those of you who can't read or have no common sense: the first little icon shoots one bullet at a time at incoming enemies.  Next icon, (ship wheel looking thing,) shoots out in all directions. Fire icon melts ice balls that will eventually come, or shoots one bullet at regular ones. Blue spiral thing...can't remember. Hot air balloon follows enemies &amp; shoots at them. Finally, the red power icon sets up a power station.While this game may not be goty material, nor is it amazing graphics-wise (they aren't bad, just simple) it's still a good tower defense game. With other higher quality TD games on the market, this one definitely isn't worth $2.99. It isn't worth the ridiculous reviews from a bunch of morons who haven't given it more than 10 seconds worth of play time, either!",5
I am glad it was free when I got it because it doesn't respond its laggy and I hate it I only put a one star cause theirs no zero,1
"definitely not worth it, a great waste of time honestly, I was like wtf when I tried it out, and uninstalled immediately",1
"robot defense but less responsive and harder to understand even the easy setting. I hope they fix the bugs, but until they do I cannot recommend this game at all!",2
"constantly. froze, not responsive and the instructions on how to play were useless.  a tutorial. would have earned it an extra star.  I got what I paid for on this one.....nothing.  uninstalled",1
i like it but theres is no volume in it i like feeling the pop pop i was all like wtf wheres the volume,5
and you'll discover the game is basically broken. why are the touch controls so unresponsive?  I'm so over tower defense games. Guh.,2
THE STUPID GUNS FIRE ONE TIME NOT A GOOD GAME DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. GRRRRR GRRRRRRR GRRRRRR DONT BUY DONT BUY GUNS FIRE ONE TIME GRRRRR. D:&lt;,1
"It really isn't that bad. Yes, it is yet another TD style game but different elements. Yes, you need a power tower to keep charging your others. Don't flame it with 1 star unless it has ads or outrageous permissions.",4
I bought this game. I regret that I bought it. do not get it. because it is not good for your gaming device. the game is.so blurry,1
"Standard TD game, set your various type of towers, be sure to set-up power stations to keep your towers firing and as you accumulate money you can upgrade or sell and change your towers. Different type towers are needed for different types of baloons traveling the course. Bright colorful graphics show up well on Kindle Fire. There are a dozen or more layouts and about 5 difficulty levels so lots of replay value although I feel the regular price a bit high, in other words I probably wouldn't have paid the price but it's definitely a good app as the free app of the day. Thank you Amazon.",4
"all the tower just only attact the target one time,then they work again.it just occurs a lighting Icon. what does it mean? so the menu needs to be enhanced.",1
so addictng and love how User friendly the game is for a tower defense game. The maps are well designed and it has a lot of charm to them unlike most tower defense games.  It takes some great real time strategy to beat the maps.,5
"not really fun and the graphics are very elementary. I guess if you like candy you might like this game?! I don't know, I deleted it after a few rounds. I wanted to like it but it just got worse and worse....",1
"this app does not work at all on my kindle fire. when I downloaded it, (during free l) it asked me to use stuff like you would on a keyboard. like escape and enter. DONT WASTE MONEY!!!!",1
Love this game. Don't let the cutesy graphics fool you. It is a lot of fun. Well worth the price paid.,5
"My son and I really enjoy this tower defense game (I love the genre), and spent many hours over the past year or so playing it.  Yes, the graphics are a bit simple, and it isn't the best TD game out there, but it has been a nice addition to the library.  In my opinion, the 1-star reviews are unwarranted, and should be reserved for apps that really should be avoided.As for the permissions, this one really doesn't have any to speak of, so that's definitely a plus!Is it worth $3?  As much as we've enjoyed and played it, I'd say in hindsight yes.",4
A fun tower defense game once you figure out the power towers.  The balloon idea is new to me and different to most games like this.  Like most TD the fun only lasts so long.,4
"Waste of a free game on Amazon's end. Gameplay is garbage, clunky, and didn't make compared to other defense games. Hard to imagine the frustration from those who actually paid for the app.  Don't waste your time even with the free app that Amazon offers, I wasted 20 mins of my life figuring this one out and I can never have that time back.",1
"This game is fine, eve if the graphics aren't great. I started the game read the directions and played just like any other game. The tower don't just shoot once, they start slow and progress as you play.I hate that the dev is getting slammed with lies but the one star reviews are not true, read the directions and the game plays fine. Amazon has been completly run over with trolls and you people wonder why the apps are mostly low quality.the price is way too high, but the game is fine. Too bad this dev has already been destroyed.",5
"I think people are being too harsh on this game. It's really basic and not nearly as good as the other games out there because it's been around a lot longer. BB Defense and BB Defense 2 were big hits back when Blackberry had some of the best smartphones on the market. Android has come a long way in the last few years and developers have made better games. Now, I will give the poor reviews credit, the developer assumes that you have already played the first version of this game, which is why there are few instructions. But seriously people, giving this game 1 star is like a 10 year old saying the original Super Mario Bros for NES was a crap game. It's OLD people, that doesn't make it bad.",4
its free today and fun to play. there are towers that shoot more than once and so I'm upping the overall rating of this game buy giving it five stars.,5
just like the title says... its like some 14 year old kids first attempt at an app. there is that and the fact that it is a total rip off of bloons which is totally worth buying,1
"I don't know why people don't like this game. It doesn't really come with an instruction manual, though. But its very entertaining, very fun. I love playing this. HOURS of entertainment. Love, Love, LOVE it! Ok, but I have to say one thing. Its not really worth three bucks. Well...yeah it IS! LOVE IT",5
"For everyone saying the towers only fire once, you need to learn how the game works. One of the first things the game tells you is that you need a power station. That is a poor concept, and without the power station your towers only fire once. The power station &quot;recharges&quot; your towers, but can't handle a lot of them unless you upgrade the station. I gave it a one star for no sound, poor instructions, no real options menu, the use of a &quot;power station&quot; that costs a much as a basic tower and is required, and really for just being a bad game.To the devs, if you are going to force the player to use a power station for the towers either lower the cost or raise the amount of gold players start with.",1
klunky and a waste of money not even worth the free download..wasn't there just a bubble game that was horrible two days ago???,1
"This app has everything for someone who likes to play games and likes to have fun at it, likes to think about strategy a bit and likes to enjoy playing. It's easy to play but hard to win, at least on all but the easiest level, so you'll actually have to plan out a strategy to get the win on each level, and it does get progressively harder, even if the action seems repetitive. This game is one I'll keep on my Fire indefinitely and will come back to time and time again for a little respite from my daily troubles.",5
Playing this game only worsened my depression. Each tower reminds me that I suffer from pre-mature... One quick shot and then it's worthless.,5
It says it is the faotd but the price isn't crossed out? Weird. Maybe it is a daylight saving glitch.,3
"this game to me isn't a very well thought up game, I don't get how to play and the explanation they offer doesn't make since either, I rate w two stars simply Bc I enjoy the free app of the day and don't want to lose it over crappy reviews.",2
this does not evev work you start a round and they shoot once then they stop only got to the third wave don't recommend,1
I think it works fine and everyone is lying. Read the instructions before you play. Then it will be fun :),5
"I was excited to try this game when I saw that it was a tower defense game but, this was a sad disappointment. Even with directions, the game play didn't any make sense.Only one tower can fire one shot. Then that tower is useless. All the while 20 balls fly by it.. I couldnt win one game to save my life...And, that was the EASY mode!The really sad part about this game?  Prior to it being Amazons FAOTD, they were actually charging people $2.99 for this!If I could rate zero stars,  I would....",1
A fun tower defense game with simple graphics.  This game doesn't deserve the 1 star reviews.  I bought a cheap tablet and this game ran perfectly on it.  If you have an older tablet or one lacking power and are looking for a great Tower Defense game this is it.  I also play this on my Samsung Galaxy S4,5
The simplest of concepts gone completely wrong. This has to be the worst TowerDef. I have ever experienced and now it is stuck in my list of purchased Apps...  great. The control is horrible combined with poor graphics and an added bonus in the form of a &quot;power station&quot; that destroys any chance of enjoyment.,1
To all those who are morons try reading the instructions. It is a simple but fun game. My whole family likes to play this game. My 8 year old really enjoys it.,5
This is not a bad app but I think 2.99 is over price.  I am surprised this game does not have music.  Pacman like music could make the game more interesting.,3
"I don't know if the people who created this app are crazy or just people who want to pressure America.  well to get my point across loud and clear &quot;LOOK AT THE PHOTOS OF THIS APP&quot; and u will relize the Leicester of garbage this app really is.  its not tower defense.  and the name of the game shouldn't be called bubble defense because you are nit defending the enemy Wichita is the bubble.  anything would be a better name than that.  so just by that, u can tell that the game is inexperienced and just by the photographs, u can tell that this game has bad graphics and for all you know, this may not even be a tower defenestration's!!!!!!!",1
i would not get this game it sucks and not worth your time at all. It is the worst game i have ever played,1
"I saw all the bad reviews and was suspicious they were planted there by a competitor to make this company look bad.  However, playing on a Samsung Galaxy S, this game had definite issues.First, there dots not seem to be an explanation as to what each tower did.  Strike one.Second, I could not adjust the game volume.  During the game, my phone's volume controls affected the ringer, not the game.Finally, the interface was terrible.  Trying to place a tower is so difficult, in that it is so slow to move across the screen as to render it unplayable.This could have been a nice sequel.  Instead it's a disaster.",2
if your wondering why it shoots once and stop you need to buy the lightning Icon and now that I know how to play its pretty good there's no defense games for the kindle fire so I'm glad they have one,4
"this is the first time I give an app a one star rating, and the first time I can actually say it's not even worth the free download. unbelievable! The worst &quot;game&quot; I've ever come across!",1
"It has it purpose I say it not worth its price but good enough it took me two games to figure out what the heck to do but once you learn, it a fine time killer if you don't have plants vs zombies",3
"Great app: simple, effective, and very useful.  It's also free.  (This last is because I needed to add more words.)",5
This program frees memory on your cell phone.  It shows a quick display of what it has done.  It then closes and lets you get back to what you were doing.  It is a no fuss program that works as advertised.,5
"Doesn't &#34;reboot&#34; device, just refreshed or cancels out apps running in background. Name is a little misleading. But does speed up Kindle a bit.",3
"This app worked well for what it was. Smartphones seems to run slower every day and this was an easy way to shut everything down without turning the phone off. By turning off all of the programs, I seemed to notice a battery life increase, also.",5
great application when you are low on memory press the app and automaticallyfrees some memory. or when your device is feeling sluggish. i have this app on all my past phones and now on my Android tablet Impression.,5
"Fast reboot has help my Kindle fire reboot faster when I restart and when functions slow down, it works great.",5
"Fast Reboot does what is says. It's doesn't actually reboot your droid, but shuts down almost every app that is running. Once done, phone will speed back up and runs great.",4
I love Cryptogram but this is even better!! Thank you ! Haven't had any repeats puzzles. If you like cryptograms this is the game for you.,5
"This app definitely deserves a WOW.  I have been doing cryptograms for a very long time.  I started with the one in the daily newspaper.  Then progressed to the magazines and then to the JUMBO books and even to computer software for cryptograms.  Enigma is the best.  I have only had it for three days, but I have found all the settings, which sets it up to my liking. I tried two other apps, but they come nowhere near Enigma.  Thanks, EC Software Consulting, Inc.",5
I love cryptograms but I liked the Cryptograms by Puzzle Baron a lot better than the Enigma puzzles.  Give me more.,3
"This game is amazing if you love cryptograms. No mistakes. No misspellings. Different puzzle every time. Challenging without being impossible. Not too easy, not too difficult. Love it!",5
I am disappointed by the number of puzzles to solve.  I took a blind leap of faith and purchased an upgrade in spite of it  because  I enjoy cryptograms. I hope the upgrade will give me infinity puzzles to solve and improve my confidence in this game to give it a five star rating,3
If I could find the endless Fountain of Cryptograms I'd be ecstatic but this one comes close. Great quotes and challenging ones too. Great time eater.,5
I absolutely love this app!!  I love cryptograms and have looked for one for the Kindle Fire.  This is the best and so challenging!  I like being to save a game if I get stuck and want to return to it later.  I can cheat but more fun if you don't.  So many categories to choose from.  Gotta give it a five!,5
"This app simply latches on to Google maps and doesn't give you the functionality. Your phone has a timer and has Google maps.I'm all for duplicating what your phone already has but if your going to do it, it better be better than  what you already have (ex. sms vs handcent, go sms, etc) . If you want to find your car open Google maps star the location go away forget where you parked fire up Google maps again and look for the star on the map again.As for a timer there are a ton of free timers in the market there's one on your phone as well in the clock. Set a count down timer on your phone for the meter and your done.",2
Great App for finding your car at the airport or at disney land. But that's about all i can think of to use it for. Never the less I do  use it from time to time and it works great!!,5
"The app does just what it says it will do, allow you to return to a location you were previously at and it does it with a convenient user interface. Since you can share your location via SMS it needs the permissions it asks for. Good app, thanks Amazon.",4
"This app has been around on the Market for a long time and has been reviewed thoroughly on many websites. Trolls on Amazon claiming abuse of permissions are idiots. This is free today. If you don&apos;t want it because you chose to believe an idiot, don&apos;t download it and move on. The app does exactly what it says it does and does it fairly well depending on your own phone&apos;s GPS accuracy. It&apos;s not the developers fault of your GPS is way off. Go complain to the manufacturer.",5
"Unable to move to sd card, uninstalled. Cannot rate how program works. Sounded like a good idea, until the sd card part.",1
this is a good locator app. pretty accurate. big issue however is that you cannot exit the app once you&apos;ve turned it on. it keeps the phone from turning off which is a big battery drain. you have to turn the screen off manually. this is a major problem. dev please build in an exit button to turn off the app! otherwise good app!,3
"this app is great. good for nights when you're out in a city doing a bar run, real easy to find your car at the end of the night",5
I use this to find a point to reconvene with friends. I bought this a few months ago in the android market and kicking myself for not waiting to get it free.,5
"well true or not the only place i &quot;lose&quot; my car is in the sea of walmart parking.... but i need to protect my contacts. i dont need them busting down my door with pitch forks and torchs. would be nice to be leaving walmart and find my car, guess i&apos;ll stick to pressing the panic button. 3 star for the good idea, minus 2 star for the probable violation in privicy. happy free app of the day amazon, now that i will be able to cook, golf and wouldnt lose my car if this didnt look suspicious thanks to the free of of the day 4 days running (the star chart one would even let me read about it from lack of capatibility)",3
"This app accesses your phone number, like Skype or Google Voice. Verified with Privacy Blocker. 1 star for privacy invasion and lack of disclosure.",1
App glitches a bit. You have to remember to set it when you park and with 3 kids I can get distracted. It was hard to get my map back to car from walking view.,3
"I thought this app would work, but it didn't. All it successfully did was tell me how long I had been parked. As I was walking to my car the arrow was pointed at me the entire time, telling me I needed to turn around. I didn't listen to it because I knew what direction I needed to go to find my car. Good thing I ignored the app because I found my car without its help.This is supposed to be a paid app and doesn't work. At all. If I'd had listened to the app I would have been so lost.Htc My touch 4g cm7",1
With all of the idiocy in almost every free app of the day&apos;s ridiculous 1 star reviews we are going to see no one wanting to be the FAOTD. Too much nonsense over permissions when it is obvious why they&apos;re needed if you just read what the app does.  Don&apos;t ruin this by being stupid.,5
"$4, normally, for this app?!  If only everyone knew how little coding this type of app really takes they would all create their own.  I&apos;m guessing it took the developer 2 hours to make this and they are now charging $4 a pop.  Unbelievable...",3
"I&apos;ve been using this app for over a year. Got it on the Android market when it first came out. You paranoid kids are acting like the adults, terrified of every unknown, that you hate so much. Nothing about this app is intrusive or invasive. No one has ever received a text message or had their car stolen because they took a picture of a car in a parking lot with this app. \n\nWhy is the modern cell phone user turning into the equivalent of a scared, extremist conservative?",5
"I&apos;m offended by the fact that they would try to charge people $4 normally for something that isn&apos;t as good as many free apps. Does it work? Sure, but, for example, Carrr Matey is a much more enjoyable app and it&apos;s always free.",2
"This is a great app! Nice customization, allows for different views, alarms (for use with metered parking), etc. As for permissions, its blatantly obvious that the iApple people don&apos;t know what they&apos;re for. Do yourself a favor, go back to your iphone.",5
"Test device: Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialHave problems with locating you car while shopping, at an amusement park, etc?  Car locator *might* be for you.  It's pretty simple to use, and has a ton of extra features tossed in.  Simply tap the little guy in the corner and close the app.  Wen you open it again, it will show you which way you need to go to get back to your car.  Use it to take a pic of your spot and or the cars near you, just in case you need a little extra help or your car is damaged while you're away.  A lot of thought and effort went into Car Locator, and it's a handy little tool.  While obviously it's gear toward automotive use, realistically you can use it to find your way back to any spot you mark.The unhappy truth about this app though is that it relies on GPS location and a digital compass to lead you back.  While you can get away without having the digital compass, you're out of luck without GPS.  This can include times where you're in a spot where GPS signal is weak or non-existent, like a parking garage or around very tall structures.  How accurate Car Locator is is heavily dependent on how good a GPS and GPS signal you have, both at the time you mark your location and when you start trying to find your way back. In my testing, Car Locator was off by as much as 50 feet at times, which may not sound like much, but it's enough to put a good number of cars between you and where you want to be.Overall, I think it's a pretty cool app that will do what it claims if conditions are right.",4
Secretly Transmits all of your contact data over the internet to the developer.  Also secretly transmits you car photo to the dev.  Please report abuse to the Amazon app store to have this app removed and remotely wiped.,1
"I downloaded it since its free and just to add it to my apps list, which I do everyday. I did test it out and have to say it does its intended purpose well. That being said, if you do need this app to remember where you parked, there are other issues at hand.",5
"five stars to balance the idiotic reviewers. its an app that does what it says and does it well. if you don&apos;t understand the permissions that is not the fault of the developer. and also, for the freeloaders, when was the last time you actually bought an app and support devs instead of ripping apart what they put out.",5
After installing this on my 1st Samsung Galaxy 7&#34; tablet the tablet went bonkers on me. Even the pros could not reset the tablet back to factory settings. It's difficult to believe there could have been anything else responsible for bricking the tablet. I recommend you DO NOT install this.,2
"I had high hopes for this application,  but it is hard to use and doesn&apos;t quite work right. Holding it the way it described made it very hard to see the screen due to glare of the sun. Also, the radar doesn&apos;t work right; it doesn&apos;t face the right direction (it thought I was facing North when I was really facing West). All in all, I am not going to rely on it.",2
"Definitely not an app that I use every day.  I don't need to.  In those rare times that I do, it is a lifesaver.  It is fantastic when you are on vacation and have to park far away from where you are trying to go and don't know the area to be able to easily find your way back.",4
"To the person wgo thought this was a stolen car finder, you&apos;re an idiot! This is for when you go to the mall and forget where you parked. The conspiracy theorists who say the dev steals your contacts are also idiots. Amazon does a lit of research and testing on their apps before putting them on here and ESPECIALLY when putting an app as the free app of the day. Personally, I&apos;m super happy that this is the faotd because I&apos;ve been wanting it, but couldn&apos;t justify paying $5 for an app that I won&apos;t use that often.",5
"do you really believe a malicious app would not only make it past Amazon&apos;s review process but also be diguised as a really useful app.  get real and stop spamming the reviews.  this app works well as it is intended to function.  without the requested permissions, the app could not do what it has promised.",5
"4.5 stars from over 1,100 ratings on Googles Android Market.\n\nRegarding the permissions,  read the app description; they are all justified.",4
"I'm terrible at finding my car in large parking lots. Especially in huge lots like at sports stadiums or concert venues. One place in particular I frequent is an outdoor amphitheater where there are many lots, widely scattered in fields over dozens of acres surrounding the pavilion. So, I downloaded this app and began testing it out. I must say, I'm impressed by the layout, ease of use and many thoughtful features included. I especially like the feature that allows you to text-message the car's location to others in your group. At concerts or sporting events this is a nice feature to have if people get separated from the main group. Of course, this app is not just useful for finding cars - it can be used to remember any given location - say, your hotel when you're traveling in a large, unfamiliar city. I realize Google Maps can handle much of the same functionality but it's nice to have a dedicated app devoted to just one purpose.I've tested this app out and found it to be precise, accurate (to within 9 feet!) and easy to use. The user interface is simple, attractive and logically laid out. Pop-up tips explain everything the app is doing, and provides advice if you need it. It invokes Google Maps for street directions if you wish, and even allows you to take a picture of the surrounding area where the car is parked in order to help you get a better mental fix on your car's location when you're getting close.The built-in timer is a handy way of knowing when it's time to put more quarters in the parking meter. You can set the app to throw a notification when your car has been parked for the length of time that you choose. Tip: If you use this to time parking meters, it might be a good idea to set that timer for a few minutes less than the timer on the parking meter. that gives you enough time to walk back to the meter and feed it more coins. Who knows, it might save you from getting a parking ticket!There are a number of permissions involved with using this app, but they all square with the intended functions of the app, so I don't understand why so many people here are so leery of what permissions are needed.In summary, there is simply no excuse for not being able to find your vehicle if you have this nicely-designed app. This is much better than just using Google Maps, in my opinion.",5
I&apos;ve been waiting and hoping for this one to show up as the free app of the day. I had this app previously but had lost it when my Google account became compromised and I had to. create a new one. Now I have it again!\nThank you Amazon.,5
"First try, it worked very well for me.  It used GPS satellites so you need to be outside for the best results.  You use it and it acts as if your car has a homing device on it.  It gets you close enough",5
"Horrible abuse of permissions, so I didn&apos;t install. Can&apos;t say whether or not the app works as advertised, so take this review for what it is.",2
"I only downloaded it because it was free, but didn't find much usefulness out of it. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone because I think there are other products that work better.",1
"I never lose track of my car - until I go to a professional basketball game. The local arena has many entrances, and by the time I get out, I can't tell if I need to go right or left. This gets me pointed in the right direction and leads me to where I need to go. It works. Use it!",5
I have tried to use this app several times and it has not once successfully located my car. Totally worthless. The last time it said my car was 42km away when I was standing next to it.,1
"I wish I had this a couple of years ago when my friend and I couldn't remember or agree which side of Dodger's Stadium we parked on. That said, my truck sticks out like a sore thumb and I usually remember where I park. The times I HAVE used it, mostly for testing purposes, it worked like a charm.I did use this when parking in some paid-parking one time. It was nice to see how long I was parked there and made sure I returned to the right place. I can't say it saved me money, but I do think it saved me some worry.I think four bucks is a bit steep, but I would have gladly paid four bucks that day in L.A.!",5
"As a disabled mother of 3 I'll often opt to leave my wheelchair in our van on short errands and risk walking to save the hassle of the chair while with the kids.  Unfortunately, doing that usually leaves me exhausted and in pain making remembering where we parked very difficult. Having one less thing to have to remember at the end of a shopping trip with the kids, regardless of whether I'm in my chair or not, is remarkably helpful.  All of that said, remembering where the car is isn't my favorite feature.  Being able to share where I am with my husband when I get tired when we're out, especially out with the kids, and have gone in different directions to save time is a Godsend.Not only is this app a convenience, but it's actually helped me feel more independent and more safe.",5
"Why does this app need permission to install? It should run without installing. Plus there are a ton of fake dev reviews. Also, this app is used by either the government or aliens to track us. My tinfoil hat got dented last night so I&apos;m not sure which. Uh oh, here come the black helicopters! Run!",5
"Does what it says, love that the are apps that help people find their cars!! \n\nThis review is to balance out the price\/permissions\/similar-app whiny baby morons&apos; reviews.",5
"This app is put together very well. Works really well and is very easy to learn and use. I like that the GPS feature is optional and doesn&apos;t just come on automatically.. I&apos;m not sure how often I would actually use this, but it&apos;s fun to play with.",4
"there was a time I really need this app to work, but somehow it said my car was across the world....how? I tryed playoff with it, fixing my gps and still mad me bounce all over.",1
"Just read a review that someone&apos;s pissed that this app cant find your car if its moved\/stolen. Oh man...can you people READ?? First, do you see a tracking device for your car that magically appears when you download it? Oh, you don&apos;t? Well then THATs why it isnt tracking your car. Its to find your parked car where you left it. Secondly look at the details you 1 star trolls. It needs that permission to do its thing. You really think the dev left ALL these comments and gets off on secret pictures of your cars? Yeah, okay. :) App works great.",5
"This is one of the first car locator apps on the Android market and since then a lot of features and polish have been added. Many freebie apps have also appeared since then and you can even roll your own with scripting apps like Tasker. The original Car Locator is still the best of the bunch, though. Now that it is the free app of the day, don't bother with any of the others (today anyway).Yes it does ask for a lot of permissions and the Amazon marketplace is really awful about describing those to you before download an app. If you are worried, go to the regular Android marketplace and compare the feature list to the permission list before you download. The permissions are reasonable for the features you are getting.",5
The app works exactly as described. There really isn't too much to say except that your mileage my vary based on your gps chip's performance chip. The interface is simple to use and you can customize how you prefer it.if you can get this for free then it's definitely worth it,5
"I love this app!! It's not something that I'll use a lot, but is a must for when you do need it! I recently used it for the first time at the Georgia vs Florida football game in Jacksonville, FL. If anyone has been there, you know parking is crazy an you may be a mile from the stadium if you don't want to pay $50 or more for parking, which I don't! I was in a new town, with cars an people everywhere, not really knowing where I was. The app marked my car perfect, an i could even see the sidewalk that was by my car on the map. The app actually showed the stadium too so I knew which direction to walk. When the tailgating party an game was over, it led me right back to my car perfectly!! Everyone that rode with me was highly impressed with the app, and so was I. Thanks for this awesome and helpful app!!",5
"I&apos;m usually lenient when it comes to app permissions, but I think this one is taking permission abuse to a whole new level. Why does it need to know my contacts info and send\/receive sms messages?\nDid not install.",3
This would be a good app if it didn't access so much of your personal info such as contacts and phone state. Unnecessary.,2
"This app is ok, it does what it says. But there are apps that do it just as well for free, search the market. Most people don't need this on a day-to-day basis(at least I hope not). And the couple times I thought this would come in handy, I wasn't getting a good gps signal in the area, after that and a force close, I ended up finding the car by the time I actually had brought up the location on the map. If finding where you parked is a constant problem for you, by all means try this one out. But for most people, the free ones are going to do more than enough.Droid X",3
Just get a flag for your car. I didn't find the GPS to be reliable enough to be useful. Maybe if I was at a sporting event,1
There is no way that an app to locate a parked car needs to send and receive SMS. And no way expressing that needs 20 words.,1
there is absolute no reason for this application fee or not...not on my phone. Hey dev... I think you need to think about,1
"Definitely not worth it since it only locates the car 60-70% of the time. Sometimes it is spot on but other times it is WAY OFF.Originally installed this on my Optimus S about a year ago but it didn't always find the car, and it was a HUGE battery hog, so I uninstalled it back then.I thought maybe the app has been updated in past year and the problems would be fixed, so I downloaded the newest version and tried it again. Still the same problems. The app is constantly running in the background and seriously drains the battery. It runs in the background even after rebooting the phone, and restarts itself even after being force closed. Obviously the dev doesn't care since it's been just over a year and a lot of people are still complaining about the same things they were 1 year ago.Great idea but poorly executed. Pity, I really hoped the app would have worked right after all this time.",1
"I have disocciative episodes from brain trauma, , which means I otnen forget where I am and how to get &quot;unlost.&quot; I have a service dog now, but many don&apos;t have that ability or luxury. To the doubters of the usefulness of a reliable, simple to use version of this type of app: I&apos;d like to take you to an unfamiliar box box store, blindfold you, spin you until you are dizzy, then leave you in a random back corner. Your choice, the free version a seventeen year old kid did while waiting for levels of Call of Duty to load, or one that costs a few bucks from a professional developer.",5
"I really haven&apos;t had a need for this app but I&apos;ll keep it until I do since it was free and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll use it someday. There have been a few times I could have used it in the past but I didn&apos;t have the app. From just messing with it, it seems like a good app that will work.",5
"The app works and it's fine.  Glad that it was the FAOTD.  And for the love of God, they really need to moderate these reviews.  There is always a boatload of tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists coming here and posting.  You know what?  Nobody cares about your stupid conversations with your friends or where you live.",5
Too many unnecessary permissions are needed for this App. There is no reason they need your personal data to manage your locations.,1
"I don't really go too many places where I would &#34;lose&#34; my car.  I downloaded this to see what it would do.  It does find the car with no problem.  I only gave it 3 stars, because the app runs and depleates the battery on my phone.  Unless I go into Setting-Apps and turn off the application, I run out of battery before I get home.  Otherwise, I really do like the application.",3
"I been testin this app all day and can honestly say it don't work. When I first seen this app I was extatic. See, I live in the hood and cars are all the time gettin stolen. So to test this app, I had my girlfriend take my car to various places at the mall and drop it off. This app only took me to the place I left my car - everytime. I don't need to know where I left my car, I parked the thing! So either I'm just missin the point, or this thing don't work. Deuces.",5
"All seemed well when I saved my location but if you do anything after that, it fails miserably. After pulling down the task bar and launched the app I switched back to desktop and turned down the brightness, that&apos;s it. If you do anything with your device, it fails. We tried all kinds of senerios with the same results. \nTo bad, I was really looking forward to using it.",1
"This app only works with friends if they have it too. With that said, Google Latitude is better because Latitude is free (&amp; more people have Google accounts).",2
"This is one  of first paid apps I obtain, due to losing  my car and took t upto 2 hrs trying to remember where  I  park. Since having this app its no longer an issue. Also I used it as a tourist when I travel. And walking in a strange city and mark my hotel. It gets me back every time. In addition  the developer is very responsive with questions or concerns, his customer service was exceptional.",5
I did not install as well.  way too many permissions for something I can do on google maps. Dev. thanks for the app but I won&apos;t install until you explain the permissions.,1
Just got and haven&apos;t tried yet. For free it maybe worth a shot. Hope they didn&apos;t charge me since it is free app of the day.,4
"the app does just what it says. I just don&apos;t understand how you have a $30 to $40,000 peice of machinery that you are probably still makeing payments on, and you forgot where you put it.  There are times (like the post before me) where I can understand, but those are rare.",5
"Everything about this game is good, with one exception. You can forget about winning even at the lowest level. I like playing the game but it is like playing you are playing alone. The computer pars every hole.",2
"I play golf every day in the summer, and this game is really good to practice with using different clubs and all",4
"the sensitivity adjustments on this game Suck. Doesn't make much sense to get stuck behind a rock wall.  And to put and have the ball bounce off the pin, over and over again Sucks. This AP is a rip off.",2
"No matter which platform I buy I always look for a 3D (first person) golf game. I love the different courses (that I'll never see in person) and being able to actually hit the ball without digging a four foot trench in the landscaping! I like this version but because I don't have a lot of memory in my device the scenery changes like turning pages in a book. Be careful when you adjust your view or you will lose yourself and have to swing ""blind"". Other then that the game is perfect. Oh and the girl you play against... hubba hubba!",4
"I enjoy playing golf for real and this is great for hot days in a nice cool house, there is only 3 courses and there needs to be a lot more  too.",5
"It is very good at distance and direction but you have to be careful not to over do any action on direction! You need skills in direction especially, that part is the most difficult to control.",4
This app was a lifesaver! We were on vacation and had no way of finding out what was on TV so this really worked and was accurate! We didn't have to waste money buying TV Guide which costs $5 and runs Tuesday to Tuesday!,5
This app helps so much if you dont have cable hooked up to your tv!!! All you is put in your area code and select your network!!!,5
"I enjoy this app, it saves me lots of money because I don't have to buy the TV Guide magazine.  I was shocked that it had all the stations that are offered in my area.  HOORAH for that.",4
I Love this because I get Tv schedules I add daily. I want this here forever and ever. I want another.,5
"I've tried other TV listing apps and this is the best so far. I watch very little TV, but this app always helps me figure out what's on. My favorite option is being able to choose only certain channel to be displayed. Why bother telling me about the local channel that only displays a live video feed of the freeway? This app is a keeper.",5
This is an easy to use app.  You can quicky find out what is on.  The buttons that move your forward or back to different time slots are a little small.  But other than that it's good to have.,4
For a free app this works great. I just use it to see what is on network tv. The latest update even makes viewing shows by time so much easier.,5
Very useful to me because I don't actually have cable so I never have any way to see if my shows are on or new. This does that and also lets you customize your channel list so you only see those you need.,4
Use it all the time on my phone and kindel. dont have a dvr box for cabel so this is helpfull. very fast and always accurate. i recomend if you do not have a set top box.,5
"I have used this program on my kindle and galaxy phone...worked great. The kindle one upgraded...NOW I ONLY HAVE 1/3 of my channels that were there a few minutes ago. I sync'ed, I rebooted, I unselected all channels then re-selected all, the deselected and picked a few....no changes...shows the same 8 channels. I am not happy. I really liked this program and used it multiple times in a day...NOW I CAN'T! I'm going to delete it and reinstall...if not working, it's going bye bye from my tablet.Ok, update.....Completely delegated from everything then 're-downloaded and reinstalled...now working fine and dandy so I will now give two more stars...could easily have been 5 but I'm keeping one for the version's aggreviation!!!!!",4
"I think this is a great T V  listing for the traveler and people at home.  When I travel, it is difficult to figure out what stations are available and what may be on at the time.  This listing can find the cable companies and the local over the air listings with just the zip code. At ome obviously I have the Kindle at and and don't have to find the newspaper.  I like the TV Listings for Android app.",5
This is not what I expected but i can at least tell what is on but the layout is not very good. I use it but the times do not seem accurate. Even when I change the time zone or zip code or carrier.,3
"it worked great the first night, but then next night it didn't show any listings besides one.channel. i messed with all the settings and nothing fixed it. kind of a pointless app if it wont tell me what's on.",1
This app is handy and useful but it is rife with pop up ads. The format is a little strange and takes some getting used to.  If it were not for the ads I would give it 3 stars.,1
Easy to use. Pick your provider and it will give you a choice of channels. It is really worth it. I like my Tv and this is just to Cool! :),5
"I find it much easier to get current TV listings on my android device using this app, than I ever have using website on the WWW via PC. Enter your zip code and cable company one time and the app remembers these settings. One swipe of the thumb and you are looking at complete, detailed listings for your area, starting with the current time. You have the option to scroll backwards and forwards to see what you might have missed, or what's coming on later. Very nice!",5
"This is a great app, you can customize to show your fav. stations. I had tv guide and didn't care for the app. I really like this one.",5
My title says it all. Not sure what happened after the update but the app is missing nearly all of my areas channels. I will be deleting and looking for a replacement.,1
"This is a good basic TV listing. It was easy to eliminate the channels I don't have. Not perfect but it is free, so don't complain.",5
"Very conveinnt & accurate, to just pull my kindle ou,  rather than looking it up on tv, the scroll goes by so slow, and more than half of screen is a movie playing..",5
"If you live in zip code 50266 don't bother downloading. Apparently we don't exist. Did the spinning ""working"" icon for about 5 seconds then a blank screen. Did the same whether I was connected through 3G or WiFi. Tried multiple times (obviously) and got the same results. TV Guide works here.",1
"5stars. This is a simple, easy to use program. It is really well designed. The fastest way to find out what is on Tv",5
This Tv Listing guide is another great freature Amazon has included in the Kindle Fire HD!!The newspapers have taken away the tv guide listings and sell it separately or the print is so small you need a magnifying glass to read it and it's only a half day.This listing is taylored to you zip code and I couldn't be happier. I was considering purchasing a one year TV Guide listing for but don't have to know and SAVED $65.00!!!!The Kindle Fire HD is the best gift I've ever gotten.Thank you Amazon and TV Listings for Android!One delighted customer!!,5
Very disappointed with this app.  The app would not let me set the correct time and day so all the shows are wrong.,2
I haven't had any problems with this app. I like the details about programs and being able to see a channel's whole day of programming.,5
Not as good as TV Guide App which is available for the ipad but not available for the Kindle Fire.,3
Shows all the program listings and is easy to use. Easy to download too.  Like all the features of it.,5
"I liked it before the recent upgrade and I like it even better now. It was a little wonky and wouldn't keep channel filter settings sometimes, but it always kept my location. It's a lot prettier after the upgrade and retains my channel settings. It opens quickly and I don't have to make an account or sign in or fool around with anything. Awesome.",4
The app is the best television guide available. Inlike that it provides the next two schedule shows for the channel.  And the app is free. Great!,5
"This is a very useful app for my Kindle Fire.  My only minor complaint is that occasionally it seems to scramble times and shows.  Overall, it's worked well.  It's nice being able to see whats on at a specific time, or see the lineup for the next few shows on one channel.",4
"I was pleasantly surprised on the value and functionality of this free app.  I have over-the-air antenna TV in the Los Angeles area and receive 120 stations.  This app found them all when I provided my zip code.  It permits easy 'filtering' to delete those that are of no interest.  After deleting ones of no interest, it lists all the remaining (in my case 23) in increasing numerical order.  For each channel in this window it gives three listings, what's currently on, and the next two listings.  What I found wonderfully valuable, when a channel from this list is clicked-on, it opens another window that shows all the listings for that one channel for the rest of the day, and even into the next day, along with a detail description of each listing.  It also allows one to scroll back in time to see what was on earlier, so one can see if a desired show has been missed.My Samsung 46"" HDTV has a nice TV listing capability, but this 'TV' app is even better.A few additional comments (room for improvement):- when in the detailed listings window for one channel, clicking on the back arrow on the Kindle-Fire returns one to the 'main' TV window.- the search feature, which is accessed via the magnifying glass icon on the Kindle Fire menu bar, only searches current programs.- there is no 'help' or instruction page, but except for a few items like the above, most are self-event.02/08/14 UPDATE:Since the `upgrade' of the `TV Listing' app in December 2013 the channel filtering capability has become unreliable, making this app far less user friendly than it was prior.  As such I've downgraded my rating to 3 stars.While many channels can be successfully filtered-out (in my case 120), they typically reappear after one or two additional uses of the app; that is, exiting the app and returning to it at a later time.I've come to learn that the created filter is not lost, but is simply not being applied.  A total reboot of my Kindle Fire tablet does, in fact, result in the filter being applied without having to recreate it.  However, rebooting the KF is time-consuming, and otherwise of no value (The KF sleeps beautifully with no noticeable battery drain, and it wakes from sleep much, much faster than the time it takes to reboot it.)We user's will of course be very grateful when the channel filtering capability is returned to its former reliability.The TV app is otherwise a great app.  When, and if, the channel filtering is returned to its prior functionality I will again update this review and upgrade my star rating.04/27/14 UPDATE:As of the April 2014 upgrade of `TV Listing', the channel filtering capability now works perfectly.  Along with other improvements such as the capability to separately list movies, sports, documentaries, etc. for not only the current day, but also for any day in the following week, this app is outstanding.  It now also has a search capability to find a specific desired showing, as well the ability to set an Alert in advance of a desired presentation (my Kindle Fire gives off a loud buzz).  This app now easily deserves a full 5 star rating, and then some!",3
"Used to have small, barely intrusive banner ads. I guess they got greedy, now ads take up half the screen, freeze/lock up the app, and all but cripple my tablet. Uninstalling.",1
"Well after using the real TV Guide on my smart phone this needs a lot changes to make it easier to use. Lacking a lot, hopefully it will make changes in the future or Amazon can get the real TV app. But I won't hold my breath. I'm still waiting for them to carry some locale apps that both of the other big name apps download sites carry yet Amazon doesn't if they can't produce the apps for kindle like Google or ios site they need to get out of the app business. I love my Kindle except for this issue. As it is now you need to carry two devises to get the apps you need",3
We were looking for an app like this when we got our OTA antenna. It installed easily and the set-up went perfect.  The first step to get rid of your expensive provider. Now if only I could find a HD recorder.,5
"I wanted a TV guide app for my kindle fire but I don't like this one as well as the TV Guide app on my i-touch.  I guess this one will do in a pinch, but the formatting and user-friendliness is not great",3
"I put it on my Kindle so I could tell my Mom what was on TV.  I like that it shows the next 3 shows for each channel, plus you can choose favorite channels, so narrow down your search.  I just wish the favorite channels could move up in time, like the main page.",5
Where do I find out how to use it other than see the listings? If I can see instructions and if it works I will give it a better rating.,2
"This is ultimately a really good app. You can filter out the channels you don't watch and keep only those you do watch.This would get five stars except for one problem: Every now and then it loses the settings I've put in it and I have to do the settings all over again. It's very frustrating when it does that.Other than that, it's an app I heartily recommend!",4
"I found this to be very helpful as it not only tells me whats on TV, but will also give a brief description of the show.  Seeing our local paper not longer gives listings it was just what I needed.",4
"This APP displays all local channels.  You choose whether you have cable, local, or satellite.  Then displays future shows.  Personally, I do not like free apps.  I do not care for advertising ads.",4
"Only shows an hour of programming at a time.  I'm looking for a grid with three hour span or at least 2 hours.Edit: once I figured out how it works I decided I like it.UPDATE: When it worked it worked well, but it just stopped working at all.  I uninstalled it and reinstalled it twice, but it still wouldn't work.",1
"I like this app because the setup was easy - put in your zip code and what cable / satellite provider you have - and presto.. it shows you all the channels and their current playings, as well as, the next few hours worth.  It even showed me the HD channels that we have on DirecTV.  It's faster to use than the listings through the ""Guide"" on my remote :)",5
Gives up to date information regarding television programs . I use it on a daily basis to determine what programs to watch during the day.,4
"This displays a TV schedule covering several hours at a glance for all channels based on your area and provider, much like an on-screen TV schedule.  However, being able to see 3 shows per channel at a glance is nice and the ability to drill down to the complete schedule for any particular schedule is excellent, especially for movie or sports channels.  And you can't beat the price!",4
"I started loving this app and using it often!  Imagine my dismay when with a subsequent refresh/update 1/3 of the screen of my kindle was covered by an ad!!!!!!  VERY OBTRUSIVE!!  Not to mention ANNOYING!  Even with deleting and re-loading.it remained to obscure the screen......sometimes more than half.  If you only have 3 channels, this is great....otherwise I cannot, will not recommend!  Not worth the price(free) or your time.",1
"I LOVE this app!  I can check TV listings whenever I want, wherever I am (as long as I have WiFi) without even turning on the telly!  I can choose the time of day I want to watch, I can read a synopsis of the programs, and set reminders for the shows I want to see.  I don't have to log in (otherwise I'd probably have just used the listings by my cable provider).  I can also remove the channels I don't watch.  That means if I'm watching to just relax I don't have to look at any of the news channels, financial channels, sales channels, or programs in languages that I don't understand.  This is really convenient and useful.  And best of all FREE!!!",5
HANDS DOWN BEATS THE SCHEDULING GUIDE ON YOUR TV!!!!!!I love that I can make my own viewing guide by  eliminating all the channels I don't like.  It's so much easier to look at programming by scrolling on my KF instead of endlessly pushing a button on the remote control to look at page after page of programming.Also love that I can pick sports and see all the teams playing at the same time so I can quickly go to the channel I want to watch.  Ditto for movies.Viewing the entire line-up for one channel each day is so easy and quick.My only complaint is that I can't save my home viewing area and set up a new one I go on vacation in another viewing area.,5
"awesome tv guide.  especially nice because we didn't have the guide on our cable channels.  also great for travel.  I put in the local zip code and can find my shows, times and channels.",4
Great tool to stay abreast of the 4-5 shows worth watching each week.  I try to keep my boob tube watching to a minimum and this ap helps me pick the shows I actually want to watch without be mind numbed by the normal stupidity and reruns.  Has just about any &#34;normal&#34; service provide you can think of for just about every where I've ever traveled in the US.,5
An excellent tv guide. Works real smooth on my android tablet and gives my tv listings. Use it all the time. A very nice app.,5
"This app was recently updated and got some bad reviews, but it was only down for a day.I use it every day and love it!Nothing compares to this - it is the best TV guide.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.",5
this is the perfect app for setting your Tv watching schedule for the night! I watch a lot of dramas at night and sometimes some cable shows repeat later at night and this guide goes till 5 the next morning so I can catch my shows and not have to watch them on-demand on my cable!,5
I love how this app shows me the guide for cable since my new provider doesn't offer a channel guide.The only problem is the in app ads. They are huge and take up half of the screen. I tried to find a way to pay to eliminate the ads but there is no way.I am very disappointed. I think I'll look for another channel guide app.,2
"I have been looking for an app to simply show me what's on, what time and perhaps some information about the shows and this fits the bil nicely.",4
I can't get the cable stations with this app.  No matter how I try it won't work.  I've done it with my i-phone with no problems at all.I can't go past the current time so if I want to see what's on an hour from now (on local stations) I can't do that either.  Even for free it's not worth it.,1
"Love the color codes for shows, sports, movies. I always use this app. saves time flipping through commercials! Time saver!",5
"Since I don't subscribe to the daily paper, I refer to this app to see what's on TV in the evening. It's saved me a lot of frustration!",5
"This is ok if you're only looking for what's on right now but iTV has been much more useful to me. I like the display on iTV better because it shows the channels in a list and the times across the top of the screen like the typical TV guide that I'm used to and you can scroll ahead on the times. I tried this one because sometimes iTV is glitchy and I wondered if I could find a more reliable app but even if this one is more reliable, the difference in display wasn't worth it for me.Amendment: After further problems with other apps, I've gone back to this one. It's more reliable and has not once caused a problem on my Nexus 7. You can move ahead to look at the times or look at the schedule for an individual channel.",4
"The app is good,just not what I was wanting.The alerts I was getting were not my favorites.Maybe I did not set it up correctly. I would really like a calenderwith the favorite shows on the dates with the times.Still searching for something else.",3
I use it many times a day.  I only gave it 4 stars because nothing is perfect.  This is better than looking in the newspaper or using the cable guide,4
used to use this a lot but for some reason cant locate my zipcode! !! I uninstalled &amp; reinstalled it --- hmmm cant locate Los Angeles CA,1
"I absolutely love this product. This surpasses our cable viewers guide by 1000%. The ""TV Listings for Android"" does take a bit of getting used to, but it's more than just an app.Thanks for having it!",5
"It good if you want to see clips from talk shows like Leno,  Conan, something fun to share with co workers, If you seen something enjoyable the night before.",4
This app works well. It gives all of the local TV listings and is correct in the details regarding local programs & reviews of the programs.,5
"It's a really neat app to see what's on TV now and what's coming on in the near future. It's highly customizable to the channels you get and is kept very accurate and up to date. I highly recommend it. The only room for improvement would be to give those of us who use both an antenna and cable a chance to have both sets of listings displayed at once, but I found a second listings app that I use for the over the air channels.",5
"Workable.  Set to my cable company.  Brings up programs.  Can click on a channel and get the listing for the day in one place.  The search function leaves me frustrated, but haven't really spent much time with it.  Usually try once and give up (don't want to take the time to figure it out or when it seems to skip what I have typed in??????).",5
"I really like this app. I use it all the time, even though I have a newspaper I like this because you can find out more about the program.Donna",5
works well on the kindle fire.  has all my channels.  very easy to cofigure and use.  don't have to turn on Tv to see what is on.,5
I spent a lot of time entering my channels by filtering them only to have it do an update and lose all my preferences.  I'll be removing it from my Kindle HDX. Thanks anyway.,2
"I use to pay for a TV Guide Magazine subscription until I found this app. This little app is excellent for those who just want to know what your listings are. It's easy to use. You can look ahead to see what is coming on later in the day, or the next day.I would give it a 5 star rating if it weren't for the fact that the app can be buggy on occasion. But hey --- it's free and it's so good in so many other ways, I'm not going to complain too much.",4
I'd say this is a great app. Cept it's not. Sure it will list your local cable/digital program channels. But in order to even be notified about a program that is coming on you have to leave the program running in the background. Ultimately making you force close it. Might be usefull to select individuals that can't get something else.,1
"Just loaded this app and,  so far,  am enjoying it.  It seems to be just what I was looking for.",4
"I've been using this app for some time and I have always considered it a 5-star app.  The interface isn't perfect, but it works well and makes it easy to find what you are looking for.  You can configure your TV provider and select the channels that you want to see.  The only real issue I've had ongoing is that it occasionally adds additional channels that I am not interested in and I have to remove them, but I can do this from the main screen, so it isn't a big deal.Recently (the past couple of months), however, it keeps losing the configuration info.  It still knows my provider, but the channels I am not interested are no longer excluded.  There are over 700 channels with my TV provider and while most that I am interested in are at the beginning of the list, there are some that are not and it is a pain to scroll to find them.  It takes a couple of minutes to reconfigure.  There are options in the configuration screen for &#34;select all&#34; and &#34;deselect all&#34;, which is great because with so many channels, I can deselect and then simply select the ones I want, but the fact that I recently have to keep doing this is a deal-breaker.I waited to post such a review because I wanted to give the developer a chance to correct, but apparently they are either unaware of the problem or uninterested in fixing it.  In the meantime, I will be looking for a new tool to get my TV listings.I am running on a Kindle Fire HD.",2
Best app I have on my tablet.  Just put in zip code and type of broadcast you are looking for and you get a complete listing.,5
I don't have a cable box in my room so when I need to check what's on I just have to go to this app I LUV THIS APP SO MUCH (:,5
"Just got this as a free app.  I really do like the ease of use and its speed.  You can find info about over the air programs, satellite, and cable. You can narrow your search to only the channels you want.Maybe I just don't know how to save my choices, but when I switch between satellite and over the air (OTA) programs I lose my selection of favorite channels. Then when I switch back to OTA I have lost those favorites, also. This is the only drawback to this app that I see. If this problem was worked out (or if I find out how to do it right) I would definitely give it 5 stars.This is still a good app since my TV doesn't show me info on OTA programs in advance.Thanks to the developer for making this a free app.",4
"We have Comcast, and when it comes to the ""premium"" (a matter of opinion) channels, they only list one each for HBO, Strz, etc. high definition channels. For programs in Hi Def, you have to go to ""On Demand"" for each of the premium channels.That may not make sense to you, but there isn't much sense about 900 channels to begin with. And that's where TV Listings for Android comes in. I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire, and up popped 900 programs for every half-hour on almost every channel we get. And THAT was great except that I don't ever watch 830 of those channels.In order to ""delete"" the channels that you don't watch, you have to check them off and delete them one at a time. This would rate 5 stars plus if there was a way to block, say channel 300 through 699 and delete them. After that, there's another group of 200 channels, and then I wouldn't mind picking out individual channels.Right now, even after some selection, when I want to see what's on at 9 PM, I'll get a list of 400 programs.Now, if that app would like to go a step further, I'd like to be able to delete individual programs that I will never watch ... like Tivo.",4
"LOVE LOVE THIS APP.!!!!! I CAN NOW LOOK UP TIMES FOR MY FAVORITE SHOWS AND SEE WHICH ONES I CAN SEE AT A LATER TIME AND NOT MISS A SINGLE ONE, AND I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FIR THE SCROLLS ANYMORE !!",5
"Something I use and works great.. People even vote on what they feel might be the hottest movie of the night, love it!. Fallow my reviews on amazone to get right to MUST HAVES FOR KINDLE FIRE, and if you have a must that I don't, be brave and e mail me.. I 'm here to help with anything.. It's EZ when you SEEK, so enjoy EZSEEKs must haves for kindle fire.. Enjoy all!!..",5
"Good App.!  Would like to read the listings going across the time schedule, instead of downwardly. Overall, a pretty good app.",4
If you want to bypass the Su;nday paper TV guide and you don't have on screen TV listings or TV guide it is remarkably accurate and gives a concise accurate description  of the programs listed.,5
"This app doesn't have my cable provider... &gt;8[  TV Guide app does.  I need more words before I can submit my review.  Geesh, I still need more...",1
It is to &#34;linear&#34; ... i.e. guide is not layed out in a grid format.  I prefer to use the online grid supplied by DISH Network. where I can see several hours and about 10 channels on the same screen grid.  I removed it from my Kindle Fire.,2
"Long ago, we cut off the too-expensive pay for too many channels you'll never watch cable. We only get over the air channels now. It's rather quaint...there's a small selection of channels, but I typically find something on when I want to watch. It's like when we were kids....good sitcoms in evenings, family stuff in afternoons, kids stuff after school and cartoons on Saturdays, and garbage during the daytime except on one channel which runs stuff like Mr. Ed, I Dream of Jeannie, and McHale's Navy....real fun shows! This app helps us to see what's on. It's easy to browse since we don't have many stations. I set some timers for tomorrow to see how those work. I don't mind the ads as long as they don't flash ...developers need to get  paid for their service. More categories would be nice...Westerns please!",4
"IT IS VERY HANDY...MORE THOROUGH THAN THE GRID PROVIDED ON OUR CABLE CHANNELS THROUGH THE TELEVISION SET...ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR THIS APP",5
"This is a very good app. Yes it is ad-supported, but the app is well worth using even with the ads. You enter your ZIP Code, pick your television provider, and boom - TV Listings. For further control, you can filter only the channels you want to see listed and move to any time of day you wish. I use this quite regularly, it is way quicker than watching the TV Guide channel and this app is far superior to the TV Guide official app (which is pretty bloated).UPDATE December 2 2013: The latest version of this app is severely crippled by a bug. You can filter out channels that you don't want to see in the listings, but the app forgets the channels you have filtered every time you launch it. To me, this severely decreases the usefulness of the app. I'll be looking for an alternative.",2
useful when you want to find out what's on to nite fast and concise.It loaded and works on my htc inspire.,4
"This app does what it is supposed to. If you want to check the listings its great for that, it doesn't do much else. I would have liked to have maybe show previews. It works well on the Kindle Fire with no issues. It definitely saves the trouble of going through the listings, it's a quick and easy way to find what you are looking for and get a reminder of what's coming up. Basic and functional. I would recommend if basic and functional is what you are looking for.",3
Use this app most often when in rooms without the cable box guide. Really nice to not have to flip endlessly through a gazillion shows I have no interest in. Easy enough to use and set up.,5
This is merely a chronological listing of tv programs. No way to program for favorites or notification or select out channels you don't view. It is really not very helpful in the modern world of hundreds of choices.,2
"I had this app and loved it. It was a nice simple to use tv guide. They updated it and changed the format a little with some added information. Now I keep getting an error message stating I do not have an internet connection. Well I do have a good connection, everything else works fine. I can even enter the app store and give the updated version a terrible review. Please fix the problem or give us back the previous edition that worked.",1
It is great to have something like this on my Kindle.  It is a fun app for getting TV listing.,4
"This app makes it easy to find out what's on right now. That's good. However, this could be a great app if there was the ability to search listings several days out.",3
So far not having any of the problems that others are having. Has all the shows we watch with the correct times that is something as living in mountain standard time we are the forgotten ones.,5
"I have a very weird, spotty low-end cable package that makes standard listings useless. This program lets me put in only the stations I need, and is 99% accurate even for the bizarre stations! Love that I can get details on a listing if I don't recognize the name of the movie, as well.",4
I chose this rating because this really helped me when I was looking to see what was on TV.  States most of the channels I watch.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Very convenient.,5
"Since the TV Guide web page is my only source of tv listings, I was happy to find this app. It automatically opens to whatever time of day you are in and tells you what's on. You set it up to your area and whatever channels are available to you, and that's what you get. It lists not only what's on each channel right now, but it also lists what's coming up. Even with the ads, I still like it.",5
This has been my favorite tv listings app.  I like the fact that it shows the 3 upcoming shows per channel in a vertical listing and then when I select a channel I can see the upcoming shows for several hours.  I can scroll pretty quickly and easily through the list to see all the channels.  I like the reminder feature.  It is even better with the recent update.,5
"I love this app so much. When i want to see what's on Tv its just one  click away on this app. When i didn't have this app it took FOREVER to find what is on.  The only thing i don't like is when i take a channel off, (because i don't have that channel) the next time i click on it that channel is still there.",4
"I use this daily and have found several functions (advance listings, movies, reminders, etc) that are helpful.  TV Listing is also accurately tuned to actual programs in this area.",4
I love this app! So much quicker than using the guide on my Tv and I can see the next two shows that are coming up on each channel while I am browsing. When you click on a channel they show a description of each show that is coming on. This is one of my favorite apps.,5
I have had this app for a few months. With the new upgrade it is great. Ads are still there but are smaller and don't interfere as much with content. I like the search feature and the remind feature. It makes it easy to find out what is on Tv. I love it.,5
Seem to work very well.  The app contains ads but they are not obtrusive.  I wish the icon was less juvenile.,4
Downloaded this app and can't get past the configure screen.  Keeps telling me I have entered an invalid zip code. Deleted.,1
"I think this is an outstanding app.  It is free, it took very little time to set up, and it delivers great (filtered) info via a very easy to use and understand interface.I use it several times a day and it just keeps getting better.  Well worth giving a try.",5
It would have been great if I could set reminders on it. Otherwise it was just a basic tv guide that was digital.,2
to have on my Kindle Fire. Really easy and informative to use when planning my watching schedule. I especially like the way the programming has been categorized.,4
"Quick to set up, easy to use, does exactly what it says.  My only complaint is that every time there's an update I have to uninstall and reinstall.",4
I agree that the app would be better if it made it easier to select favorites. Also the selections don't get saved.,3
This has to be the most useful app I have downloaded.  It is very accurate for my area.  The price was right. :)  I will not be renewing my subscription to TV Guide Magazine.,5
My cable TV has a channel but it takes a long time to go through the channels and this App saves me a lot of time and helps me not to miss some program that I would watch if I had known was on..  I hate to loose time!,5
"I love this app.I am one of those people that has just about everything technology wise that you can think of...but for whatever reason, I DESPISE using the guides onscreen on my television to see what is on.I did that, because of lack of options, but I longed for a subscription to TV Guide.  However, the newest versions of TV Guide leave a lot to be desired, in my opinion.Along comes this App which I stumbled across purely by accident...but it's absolutely stellar.It's like having a virtual TV Guide on my tablet and my phone.  I especially like that I can filter out channels that I'm not interested in.  I have filtered out all of the shopping networks and several of the news networks, along with all of the country music channels and ALL of the ""Music playing on a blank screen"" channels.The search feature works great, and the other major feature that I truly love is the fact that you can quickly select ""Movies, Sports, or What's On"" right from the main menu.  That way you can quickly search for those several different types of items.I am giving this App five stars, but there are a few improvements that I would LOVE to see.  More auto filters would be great...such as ""Comedy, Drama, Documentary, etc.""  I would LOVE to be able to hit ""Drama"" and see which episodes of ""Law and Order"" are on at any given time.Overall, however, this is an awesome app and I'm REALLY glad I stumbled on it.I would gladly pay a few dollars for the App if there were a paid version.  Highly recommended.",5
"The latest upgrade changed the interface and made it  obsolete for some devices. The app also has connection problems with Kindle Fire. The ads are now huge and take up half the screen.  In other words, the upgrade is a disaster.",2
"I just love this App on my KF.  TV listing at my fingertips any time I want them.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves watching TV.I thought this was the TV app to have, but after getting I.TV app, I am a big fan of this one more so.  I.TV is right on target with all the info on all the TV shows available.",3
"the &#34;great price&#34; was sarcasm since there is no price for this app. however, i enjoyed finding out when television shows are on. it's a lot better to open this app than search the channels to see what's on. however, this does not give you a week's notice when the shows come on. it only gives you a day or two of tv listings. this is my only critique.",4
"Intuitive, easy to read, puts function ahead of glitz. I like seeing the lineup at a glance or following a station's whole schedule. I'm giving five stars, but wish there were a quicker way to hop forward in time.",5
"I'm not very good at this, but I was surprised that I do.like this one.  There are a lot of apps out there and it's hard to chose,  most want money and what seems like your soul too.  But this one really works, there is no confusion. It gave me just what I wanted. So far so good.I'll recommend this one.",5
"While the TV Listings are complete, I would prefer to see all listings by the hour instead of having to select channels to view their listings.",3
"I got this app to replace BuddyTV, which I liked better, but had some problems with. The best feature of this app is speed, but the navigation could be better - see below for more details.PROS: The interface is simple and uncluttered, and it's very fast. Setup is pretty intuitive. You can set reminders within the program, or use the Share with Friends feature to send it to your notes or reminders apps (which it detects automatically). The Share option also detects email and messaging apps, not just social media accounts (I don't have any set up, so I don't know whether it detects those, but the auto-detect seems strong, so I imagine it does. But it won't prompt you to log in to social media accounts you don't have or want like many apps do).CONS: Rather than a grid, it shows the next 3 shows for the selected time in list view for each channel, which is not ideal for planning an evening of viewing. The link to change the time is tiny, and hard to open without tapping the channel below it instead. Scrolling is oversensitive, so it's tough to get it to a specific channel without going past it. A giant ad fills the second screen as you scroll down, which makes it especially difficult to scroll to the channels right above and below the ad (which happen to be the ones I watch most). You can set favorite channels, but after it's been running in the background for awhile, it forgets them. There is no favorites button to bring them back, and refreshing doesn't help. You have to go back to your home screen and reclick the icon, sometimes 2-3 times to get it to show your favorites again. The reminder times are preset, with no custom option (so it will remind 5 or 15 minutes before program, but not 10). This is a minor issue, with an easy workaround, however - as mentioned in Pros, it auto-detects your reminder and notes apps through the Share with a Friend function, so you can swiftly export to another app with customizable time settings.CONCLUSION: All-in-all, this app is just OK, although it is faster and simpler than most. A few navigation tweaks (larger and better separated time changing button, smaller ads, slower scroll) and fixing the favorites caching problem could build on that to give it a major leg up over the crowd, but as it is now, I'm ready to jump ship if I find anything better.",3
seems alright but have not used it much yet but hope to use it more then the one that comes in the paper,4
"This app works just right for our TV setup. For some reason, TV-Guide and EyeTV for Mac cannot seem to get all of our channels right. But this app is flawless.",5
The app is a snap to configure and has accurate listings for the criteria defined. Detailed program descriptions are succinct but informative enough to give a thorough synopsis of the program/episode being researched.,5
Just what I wanted. This app works nicely on my Kindle Fire and I like it better than others I've tried. 5 stars,5
Not what I wanted. I use TV Guide instead.,1
Everytime I tried to access this app it froze my phone up and I could only recover it by turning it off.,1
"I use this app everyday. I like the simple layout, which makes it easy to read. It lets you bookmark shows and set a reminder, which is pretty handy. Overall I would say get this app.",5
"Set up was quick and easy but it had the listings in the wrong time zone. I uninstalled it and re-installed it, and it was still incorrect. My cable company is small, and although this app had it listed as a choice, it did not have the correct information for the television show listings.",1
"This app gives me everything I am looking for in a tv guide. I can see what is on now and for the next few hours at my own speed, not at the scrolling speed that shows on my tv. I can also see everything showing on any channel all evening, with a brief synopsis included. It linked up to my current cable system with no problem.",5
Installed by mistake.  Don't need this app.  Guess i should pay better attention  when  i'm shopping for apps at the store.,1
when i first got this app several years ago I really liked it though itch was a little too simple but the latest update has really elevated its completeness...so THANKS!,5
The last upgrade has a cute Icon but what good is it if the App no longer works on my kindle. I use to use this App every night and now all it does is confine to say &quot;Loading &quot;. Please undo what ever you did.,2
Easy to set up and use.  It has a very simple display without a lot of junk to trying to sell stuff.,5
Love this little app.  We do not always get a TV paper to check out was it on TV each evening.  It is easy to pull this up on my Kindle and check it out.,5
"I've tried out several TV programming apps on both iOS and Kindle. This one is definitely the best so far. It gives you a clear listing of what's on as well as what's coming up in the next couple of hours, and with a tap you can zoom in on more details about the program and the channel. This is what the on-screen guide from my cable provider should look and work like.",5
"I really liked the old version, then they updated it. It was okay, not as good, then they updated it again. Now it does not work on my LGG2 nor my wife's Moto X.",1
"This has my favorites, my emmys, my oscars, new picks, this is going to be great, love it just going through it.",5
Very accurate and saves me from buying the local Sunday paper just for the TV guide. Like the way I can zero in on my preferred channels.,5
but it locked up so I uninstalled an reinstalled and now it no longer recognizes my zipcode.  I rebooted my kindle fire and tried again. no luck. used it the entire past year and loved it. too bad it no longer works,3
You put in your zip code and there are all you channels and descriptions.  I switched to digital antenna tv and it lists all the digital channels that are available in my area.,5
"I like how you can delete channels that you don't have on your tv or choose to not watch so you can see the schedule of programs easily.  You can cater it to yourself, it's simple to use, of course I do not have cable and that may make it easier to use???  But regardless, I have no qualms with it.  :)",5
"This app is awesome! I really do prefer this, than going through my cable guide! Now, I know there might have been several issues in the past. But, someone must have read all the complaints, and got to work! The only way to improve this app, is to stream live television when a listing is pressed. Awesome!",4
This is a great tv guide for checking on shows and times. I like the way it goes in detail on the show and the plot to the show!,4
This was great till they decided to &quot;improve&quot; it.  Now it insists I'm not connected to my wireless.  Can I have the old simple app back?,1
"No problems so far. We will see how long that lasts, lol. Usually after a month they stop working properly....",4
I have nothing but great  things to say about this app. It is accurate and easy to use.  What I like best is how easy it is to see what is on a certain channel for the entire 24 hours. Using the alarm I never miss something I wanted to see. No annoying ads either!,5
I have cable with no guide and this app fills that void beautifully! It is easy to use. I just pop into it to set the TV and back to multitasking between the droid & TV,5
"This app used to be great. I used it all the time. It had an acceptable, nonintrusive banner ad at the bottom.Now due to massive ads, the listings take up no more than one third of the screen! Even when clicking on the ad and going to its website, it remains when returning to TV Listings.A previously great app is now essentially useless and beyond frustrating when you want to quickly see what's on television right now. All because of the developer's greed and complete lack of concern for its customers.This app currently has an average rating of 4 stars, which was well deserved before. It has no longer earned the right to be rewarded with a high rating nor to have customers show their support by downloading it.Until the developer has a change of heart, I urge everyone to refrain from downloading this useless program and that all past reviewers change their rating to one star... since, unfortunately, it is no longer a 5-star app.",1
"The app is very helpful, and I enjoy it. However, I wish HD package listings were available for this app. Other than that, the app is great!",4
"I've bee using this app for 2-3 years and was happy with it until the so called upgrade. This new version, while glitzier, is buggy. Sometimes works, sometimes won't connect to my network. Also the previous version allowed you see TV schedules several days into the future; I can't find how to do that now and the channel filtering is more laborious. I'm giving 3 stars because when it works it's okay but as it is it's way too undependable in this new iteration. If all the kinks are worked out I'll edit this review. However, since the old version worked so well why can't they just 'downgrade' back to it (or 'upgrade' back to the old version)?To top it all off I tried the 'Contact Us' button. It asked for my email address as was expected. What was not expected was asking for my email password - wtf!!! To say the least I aborted my attempt at contact. Seemed like an attempt at phishing or ID theft to me.4-7-14 UPDATE: I found the feature that allows you to see future schedules but only for one particular channel at a time. In order to see future schedules you must tap on each individual channel. Again, cumbersome and laborious. Also when I opened the program today I found all OTA channels listed - not filtered for my channels. Oh boy, how long is it going to take to get it right??!!! Have downgraded to two stars.",2
Larger fonts than TV Guide app and better layout. Makes it easier to read on smaller screens for those of us who don't have HTC Evo or Samsung Galaxy size screens. I can actually read it on my LG Optimus V small 3.2&#34; screen.,5
I have this on my Kindle Fire & love it. I use this to see what is on & what is coming on later so I don't miss shows I want to watch. I use this mostly when watching TV & I don't want to go to my computer to check on shows coming up.,5
what's the point of downloading this app if u can just check your Tv guide? Also u cant c any Tv shows. ur only seeing Tv listings. I dont like this app.,2
i the app a  lot. quick way to see what is on Tv. app works as stated. also like the time format.,4
"This app is customizable for your area which is nice!  The only thing that I wish it had is a drop down to jump to a channel, rather than to scroll to it.",4
I like this app other than at random times..when I really want to know what is on....I get &quot;No programming scheduled at this time&quot; well the Olympics are on so I know there is SOMETHING on. I use a major cable company as my carrier...are they no longer in love with this app? So worked fine for awhile..now sort of jiffy as I get this message more and more often...*sigh* why do people tugged up a good thing?,2
"Handy app allows you to choose your TV carrier, and then view what's coming on shortly, as well as in the future. My cable company doesn't have an app for my phone yet, so this is filling the gap.",5
"The old version was ok, but required lots of adjusting.  The new version is pure joy to use...it's simple to scan and very handy...you'll find that you'll be depending on this app.",5
dropped cable recently. easy to set up for my location / service. better than loging into to tvguide.com use every day.,4
"This was a huge 5 stars app, but now I wouldn't give it even the 1 star that I did.  On 4-4-14 this app changed.  First I noticed that programming after 6:30 PM that day was not listed.  Second the logo changed and the name was a little different.  I tried removing it and then reinstalling it, and now I get that the app is not reading the internet.  THIS IS WHY I DON'T UPGRADE APPS.!!!!!!!!24 HOURS LATER 4-5-14 THE APP IS BACK.!!  THANK YOU!  Now it offers 7 days of programming, category selection, and better information  on your selected programs.Because of the advertising window, which is still annoying, I NOW GIVE THIS APP 4 STARS.!!  Check it out, again.IT IS MY OPINION,since this app has a new logo,a new name and new features,it should also have new reviewing stats. Which is looking like (2) 4 stars vs (12+) 1 star.My suggestion is delete this app 100% (device,cloud,and app library) wait a day and then reinstall. That's what I did.",4
Do not get this app it is a waste of your time and  effort I am glad it is free.,1
"I get 24 OTA channels, this app only shows 5 of those channels. No thanks, deleted it. Needs to show all the channels.",1
It has been quite a helper when watching TV in another room without &#34;box&#34; and no other means to see what is on for shows.  I didn't realize how much I would use it.,4
"Loved it at first, flawless...then when advised it was update time,well, it wouldn't! Would not update properly, even tried uninstall/reinstall routine. No help...sent 2 emails to developers but no response either!",1
I set it up with reminders and that was the end of it.  Opened it a few times and the screen was blank.  Uninstalled.,2
"This app is easy to set up for your TV area and type of connection, whether it is cable or dish.  Gives good information on each program, and upcoming ones.  It is great!",5
"Does exactly what it should do. We get well over 60 channels with our antenna. This includes every single one, including all secondary channels.",4
This program is not what I was looking for.  I was hoping for more of a two dimensional grid like in TV Guide magazine but customizable.,3
This TV is awesome. We watch television of our antenna outside so we just pick up the basic channels and this tv guide has been spot on with the shows. I am so happy I have found this guide now I don't have to wonder what's on tv &#34;next'.,5
I was searching for a TV guide or TV listings for the television in my bedroom only. I have a regular rabbit antenna to watch local channels. (I don't have directv in my room) Now I can check the TV listings for my area and see what's on. Works on my Kindle Fire with no problems.,5
"I have the most basic of cable, so this app is great for finding out what is on and when.",4
"I remember being the weekly TV Guide in the Sunday newspaper, and this app is better than that. If you want a simple, effective guide, this is it.",4
"I've been searching for the perfect app for TV listings and I just may have found it. With the most recent update, the TV Listings by TV24 does almost everything I want. It is easy to save just the channels I want and I can select a specific program to get more details. Two more things would make this the all-time most perfect app: 1) Provide an option to view in a grid (my personal preference) and 2) Allow the ability to open the app on a computer to print the listings to share with the family.Great job! I plan to tell everyone I know about this app!",4
"This TV guide app works dependable and is very easy to start up.  I do receive cable channel info.  It is better than a paper guide.  There is no info for Sundance Channel and I watch that a lot.  It is most convienent to scan channels on a format that has 3 hour programs posted ahead of that time.  You can plan ahead on what you would like to watch.  This was an easy download and you pick your cable station, etc. which it lists (every possible choice). Pretty neat app...a keeper.  Try it...you'll like it!",4
Was looking to find a easy way to see whats on tv at a glance.  Works better then any other apps.  Set it up to your area and then remove the channels you don't want and then whenever you bring it up its all up to date and ready to go.  Works well on my fire.  Would reccommend to anyone who can't always keep track of there favorite shows.  Tells you what the episode is about and if its an old or new episode.  Love it!,5
"Thanks Amazon. When I updated my PC to Windows8, I lost my Charter cablechannel tv guide app on my Kindle Fire and PC. it was really a struggle to get the channel guide and I didn't want to pay the $5 graft addition to Charter cable for the box to get the guide. Thus I found this app for my Kindle Fire TV Listings for Android which enables me to check the local cable channel guide while I am viewing my TV. Maybe small thing to others but a big deal for me since I like the basics. Thanks a ton! Amazon. If you are like me with extended basic cable and don't have the box to let you know what is on TV this is a must have for your android device.",5
This is not very good. Limited in what it does for you.This is not very good. Limited in what it does for you.,2
"I use this app almost everyday.  I like that it is free and gives me enough info to determine what I want to see on tv daily or even a few days into the future.  I like the formatting/layout of the schedule: ubcomplicated, and convenient...and once again, it's free!!",5
this is gone didn't really need this for my Kindle fire. might better suited for others who require it but not for me under wifi connection,3
"I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  This app has some nice features and one that doesn't work for me.  Under Settings I should be able to ""Filter channels"" so that I can scroll through only those channels in which I am interested instead of all 542 of them (similar to the Comcast Favorites feature).  This feature works for a while then loses my input and I am back to scrolling through 542 channels.  I'll put this app on the back burner until they get this issue resolved.",2
I like this app and find it handy  to see what's on in present time.And you can change settings to where ever you happen to be.If you are interested in a show and want to read about all you haveTo do is click on it to get information about your chosen show.,5
This tv listings is the greatest.  Lots better then the old one. Thanks for doing a better job. As l stated the word needs repeating Awesome!!!,5
Whenever I watch television in other room of my home I need to know what is on without having to change the channel or interrupt others viewing.This is an excellent app for quickly looking to see what's on.,5
This is great to use and see all the channels and shows that are coming on in one compact place.  I have it on my kindle and love it.,5
"It's simple, straight and down to the point! does what it says, works great on the fire! overall great app!",5
I was able to set this to only show me the channels I receive - excellent! No more wading through a bunch of listings for channels I don't even get.,5
"I loved this app until it suddenly dropped my listings. Instead pf 600+ channels on Time Warner Digital, it tells me I only have 34. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app,  but it didn't help.",2
I have been looking for something as handy and useful as this for a long time.Considering the amount of time we spend watching Tv - its great!,5
"I use over the air channels and subscriptions to various services like Netflix, Amazon, July etc. This app is perfect for the 15 channels l get for free.",5
"Even thou cable may provide a guide, this is better.  I travel with an RV so I have different tv sources, cable, broadcast. With this app I can enter the zip code of my location, select provider, such as, broadcast, or the cable company.  I get a great listing with all info, like if it is a new playing.",5
I ate bad Sushi the other night which lead to doubling over cramps before blasting diarrhea and gas so bad it nearly shattered the porcelain God. That was still better than what happened with this app.  I'd much rather sit on the toilet hoping the hemorrhoids don't explode with so much blood that I bleed to death than leave this app on my Kindle Fire HD.  I'm guessing the developers got beat up by either a girl or a girly man (no offense to my girly man friends).,1
"I like to always know what's on TV, and this app is perfect for that. The type of cable that I have has a 'guide channel' instead of one you can scroll through, and it circles through each of the channels VERY slowly. The music on this channel is also SO annoying, so I really wanted to find a way that I could just quickly look through the channels to find something good. I found a website that worked okay (titanTV) but many of the channel numbers or programs were often incorrect. I got this app just on the off chance that it would work better, and it DOES! It's so easy to use, and (thus far) everything it's said has been right. Fabulous app; a must for any avid TV watcher.",5
I love this as I can check out what is on TV and not have to hunt on line for it or find a TV guide in the paper.,5
Too confusing and hard to understand. Does not breakout the various services by location at least not easily for a novice user.  Have been using this to see the primary channels and offerings to get an idea what to watch.,3
"Keeps me updated on all my intended shows I plan to watch. Sometimes I'm looking for a special program, and this app tells me the time and channel it will be on. Recommend to anyone just to save guess work on what programs are playing when.",5
"kind of dumb nothing really on it. I really don't know how to rate this one. Not my cup of tea,",2
"If you want to know what is on your boob tube, as opposed to your YouTube&reg;, you'll want this free Android app. Once you've told it where you live, it'll ask which cable or satellite service you're using (and if you have a telephony-based service like AT&amp;T U-verse&reg;, they've got them too). Once selected, you'll see every channel available and what is on now and the next two programs to come along with their respective times. Select the channel and it'll take you to a screen that shows you what programs will play throughout the day and each with detailed episode description. Now you'll know whether your favorite show is a rerun or worth recording it on TiVo&reg;. While I wish it could allow you to remove channels you don't have (or want), still it's an extremely useful app to make your TV watching more fruitful and enjoyable.",5
"Forget ever buying another Tv guide. This is a Tv watchers dream, and it's free. Thank you for inventing this app. It's the best.",5
I loved this app &amp; used it daily.  You used to be able to pick just the channels you want to follow.  Alas... the &quot;new and improved version&quot; does not save the channels picked.  Yes you can pick the channels but when you go  back into the app all the channels you didn't  want to see are back.  The list is long to scroll thru if you are only interested in a few channels.  I have tried to save numerous times but it keeps bringing up all the channels.  I should have just stayed with the old version.,3
I don't see how people are criticising it. It has all Providers and not only shows what is on at the time but also ahead. I love it.  very handy.,5
"This app is easy to set up and use.  It does not offer my cable option. It has the company but only the basic channels, not the digital channel options. For free it is still a good value. I had to re set up after the up grade to eliminate most of the issues talked about in other reviews. I really like that I could change to another provider when traveling.",4
What more could I ask for?  the interface is simple enough for even me!  Beats amy other offerings hands down.,5
"All I got from this app was a commerical for Dennys.  The app would not play any TV programs.  Glad it was free.If I could give it Zero stars, I would.  Don't waste your time.",1
Use this all the time.  Much better than our cable listings.  Easy to eliminate channels that you're not interested in.,5
I used to like this app until they took away the easy X button to get rid of ads. Now you have to scroll past the ads to see more listings and the ads are huge!  I would gladly pay to get rid of the ads.,2
"Since our cable company has eliminated their TV guide, this &#34;TV Listings for Android&#34; app has been a lifesaver! Easily accessible on my Kindle Fire, it gives all our cable listings quickly and clearly. No extraneous pictures, etc., just the TV listings with descriptions (if you want them). Fast and easy set-up. Love it and recommend it!",5
I like this app but I think it should give details about the show also it should show what season and episode the show is.,4
"very nice app, however the reminders don't work on my Evo and I miss my shows. also this version on amazon is not the newest.",3
i've had this app for a couple of years and loved it but now it doesn't show any but ads!!  no tv listings show at all evrn ehen i verified the channel settings were correct.  deleting this horrible app!,1
"We have an OTA antenna for the local HD channels and you can pick and choose which channels you get, what order you want them in.  Much nicer than just &#34;channel surfing&#34;.  The new (updated) app is well laid out and easy to navigate and read.",5
after update it doesn't save my prefrences. darn thing sucks now. fix it people before you loose everyone. the last update screwed the thing up.,1
"Installed on Kindle Fire. Font too small and too light to read, no pinch-to-zoom nor settings to change fonts. Probably since I couldn't *read* it, it was hard to figure out how the listings were formatted.  Grids are easier to read when it comes to TV listings, IMHO.Quickly uninstalled it since It seemed like a waste of time for me.  Definitely not for someone who has vision impairment.",1
"I haven't uninstalled it yet, but its slow.I have yet to figure out how the search works, but it isn't terribly obvious.I want to pare down the channels displayed to the ones I typically watch - I'm not interested in the non-HD broadcast channels, nor yhe premium channels I don't get. I'm also nointerested in anything being excreted by Fox Noise.",2
"I had a different TV guide app. It would take forever to load, even going from one time to another. This TV guide app is great! It loads up right away not to mention, when looking up a show at say 8:00, it shows you the next two show playing on that channel and the time each show started. Great app!",5
"App loaded fine for few uses, afterwards, it would only display a message that no info is available. I uninstalled from both phones, Samsung Galaxy and LG. Loved the format and ease of use. unfrotunately, it was unreliable.",2
"If your Tv isn't large enough to read the digital guide form where you are, there is, literally, no alternative (not printed on paper).  Truly intuitive, efficient and complete.  It is, by far, my most used application. I am very grateful to have received my Fire as a gift from my wife and to discover this application, just as the void of a Tv guide solution was needed.  I have 100 csble channels and am lucky to find one thing worth watching within a 24 hour period. This app gives you the best possible chance of finding that one episode. My only suggestion would be to add ratings to help search for new favorites - something we all value infinitely on Amazon.  That was, everytime they cancel the only show that doesn't suck (e.g. Prime Suspect, Lie to Me, Medium, etc.) t will be helpful in watching for a new replacement.",5
does what I needed! you enter your zip code to get your local listings and BAM! being able to set reminders for shows is a nice feature too,5
"Needed this for my Kindle, and it does the job. Not much else I can say about it except that it's there when I need it.",4
"Put in a ZIP code, pick a server, see what's on! I've used it at home, along the west coast states, and Hawaii. Works like a charm -- and it's free!",5
"This app was awesome I used to use everyday, not it sucks I can't see the channels just advertising! So I rather deleted out of my kindle! Bye Felicia!",1
Finally an app that properly supports gps and ota (over the air) broadcasts. Wonderful and lets you delete channels you don't watch like shopping and spanish channels. A+ app!,5
"Haven't really used this app as much as I could, but seams to be O:K and useful for TV viewers",4
"We are cutting back on our cable cost--using Amazon Prime, HULU plus, and Netflix for tv/movies, and cutting down to the lowest tier of cable (until we get an antenna installed) and getting Ooma reduces our cable cost by $100 per month.  With the lowest tier of cable--basic reception--you don't get the on-screen tv grid.  This APP is a fine substitute.",4
Useless. Hard to use. Not able to find tv listings for correct area. Would definitely not recommend or buy again.,1
Not sure how to use it.  I guess if I spent more time I would be able to figure it out,3
"Its easy to use and set up.  Im editing my review as this app is the best tv channel guide I have found. This one is a keeper. I recommend this app. To be fair, there was twice a problem with it updating the listings, but I figure just as any program, nothing is perfect, but this one is very close to it!Samsung Galaxy s ii t989",5
"UPDATE on September 8, 2012: I reinstalled this app on my Kindle Fire the other day. It's been a much more stable and better performer this time around. I'm upgrading it from two to three stars for this ""second wind"" improvement.-------------------------Original Review follows:On my Kindle Fire: I installed it, set it up with my zip code and TV provider (OTA), and it found all the channels and displayed the listings. Sweet!  Or so I thought. That was yesterday. This evening, I opened the app again, and found only one obscure station listed, not even one we get. And it refused to populate with the actual channels we get, even with re-searching and re-setting. Couldn't get it to do anything except show one oddball channel.On my Asus EEE Transformer TF101: Same experience, very good performance yesterday, and then crash-and-burn tonight.Needless to say I've uninstalled it from both devices. It's very disappointing! This app did just what I wanted, when it worked. Too bad, so sad.So far, an app called i.TV seems to be doing better. But then, I just installed that one tonight. Who knows what it will do tomorrow?",3
"I recommend it profusely. best tv listings app on the market, and I always use it. other than that, simple and effective",5
"But it usually doesn't work.  At least half the time it says no listings found.  Good thing it's free, because it isn't worth any money. If you do manage to get to it, set up isn't as hard as other users have reported.  There is an option to deselect all channels and select only those channels you want to view.  But why bother if it can't find listings on a regular basis?",1
"Since I do not have cable TV, and our local newspaper only lists evening and night programming, I needed a way to tell what was on TV. This app fit the bill exactly!! I can even look ahead, and get a synopsis of the show. Thanks!",5
"The icon is cute and you can filter the channels but I will use another because I think the format could be a lot better.There seems to be a lot of underutilized space. You can see up to three half hour blacks per channel on a quick scan. But there's a block of all the times on the top. It seems there can be a showing per block. This isn't a huge deal but I mostly like to use this app to confirm a showing I'm seeing later.I like the summaries. But I don't like they only show one at a time. You click on the channel and it shows one summary. For the next one, you have to load into a new page.I tried both orientations (portrait and landscape) to see if it's any different and it's not.Also the massive ad in the middle is pretty annoying. So here's a review since the app keeps asking for one.",2
Can't open this on my kindle fire. Do android programs run on kindle fire devises? I may not have read instructions correctly. Would like to have this app.,1
I really like this because it's quite easy to customize to your liking.  It's accurate and it works and its free.  And that's great.,5
"This was a first for me... TV Listings by Jersey completely drained my battery.I was so disappointed with TV Listings that I compared it to TV Guide.  In fairness, this isn't in-depth; there may be non-intuitive ways to do things I couldn't quickly find.Configuration:TV Listings takes longer than TV Guide to start-up.TV Listings and TV Guide both have providers.  Neither has packages, so if you have, e.g., Dish HD with ~150 channels, you still have 1200+ listedYou can reduce those visible by setting ""Favorites"" in TV Guide or ""Filter"" in TV Listings.  This is easier in TV Listings; they're on one screen with checkboxes, like the Dish Network ""Favorites"" screen.  In TV Guide, it seems you have to click on each channel from the listing page and then add it to your Favorites, which is much much slower.Search:TV Listings has a terrible search.  It's slow but works, but only shows results for the current-grid half-hour.  So if you search for ""Charmed"" (which is in heavy rotation these days), you don't get ANY displayed results if it isn't on NOW.  You can hit ""+"" or ""-"" to switch time slots, but that takes another 25 seconds and you have to repeat and repeat and repeat to find if it's showing today.  So if you want to find out when ""Training Your Dragon"" is playing, you're out of luck.TV Guide search works as you would expect.  Results are listed by day, all retrieved at once, and easy to scroll through.  And you can organize by Date, alphabetically by Title (though since you still have to expand the letter-groups, that's of limited apparent value), and Genre (e.g. Movie, Lifestyle, Childrens.)  And it's faster.Device Support:TV Listings completely ignores Landscape mode.  Even with the physical keyboard open, it's Landscape.  TV Guide supports Landscape somewhat; things rotate (easier to type in searches), but the ribbon bar with ""Search"", ""Favorites"", etc. is blank.Neither program allows you to scroll to the next timeslot with a finger-swipe.TV Listings U.I. Notes:My biggest gripe with TV Listings is that every action incurs a delay.The Listing screen is nice; it shows the current and next few shows for each channel.  On my device, that's four channels per screen.  Clicking on the channel shows the listing for that channel.""Return"" does what I would expect in TV Listings.TV Guide U.I. Notes:My biggest gripe with the TV Guide U.I. is that the ""return"" button, which should go to the previous screen, instead tries to exit the app.The Listing screen shows the current show... what you are probably used to seeing.  Five per screen on my device, with space also taken by a large ribbon (""TV Listings"", ""Favorites"", ""Search"", ""News""), by the nave list and by a blank space that may typically be used for advertising.  (Most ad servers are blocked on my phone.)To see every show on a channel, click on the channel icon on the Listings page and choose a day.Summary: This is an odd situation where you can't go RIGHT with either choice.  TV Listings has a terrible search-results presentation and dreadful lag, and killed my battery.  TV Guide has lag I would have considered dreadful if not for TV Listings being worse, an abysmal filter/favorites configuration and bad choice of how to use the ""return"" key.  But I find the TV Guide search facility far more useful than the TV Listings one, because being able to easily search across times is the really important part of ""search"".Update 20 April 2012: A year later, I tried it again.  And still the same flaws.  Even on the Kindle Fire.  Default providers - 1300 or so channels for Dish.  You must deselect or select manually; it can't even distinguish between HD and standard def, so by default you get two copies of many channels.  And the Search is still only for the specifically selected time... you can't find a movie or when the show will next be on, just what's on now.Which means that not only was this weak a year ago, but it hasn't improved.  Huh.",3
"As a snowbird in Florida with a condo furnished TV schedule that just creeps up the screen and takes forever, I use my android tablet to scan what's available and remove the channels that I don't want.",5
easy to review what' s on and when a certain program will broadcast. tv guide adds special reports as well.,4
this app really does provide a full listing for my cable company. great ability to customize what channels I see listed,5
Incredible App! Have OTA free tv. Lists all local channels with times and descriptions of shows and movies,5
"It's nice and user friendly, but when I surfed through the channel lineup a great deal of channels were missing. Ones my family watch.",3
I could not get this product to provide the off air  TV listings for my area. I do not recommend it.,1
Love being able to check to see if my show is new. Very quick and convenient. Can easily customize to your cable network.,5
"I have basic cable as I don't watch a ton of tv, and to use my cable guide takes forever to scroll through the hundreds of channels.  I installed this app and hid all channels I don't have or don't want to watch and now only see my channels.  Great app for looking ahead and planning any movies, etc. too!",5
"Don't use it hardly at all.  Quicker for me just to look in the paper.  Need one just for sports...movies, etc.",3
I have used this app on two phones and now my Fire. I don't notice the huge ads that other reviewers complain of. It is very easy to set up your cable provider and select your channels.  I recommend this highly!,5
"Don't have TV guide, don't get the paper, but do know your cable company, then this app will help.One draw back is going though and deleting all the channels you don't have.",4
I have never been a fan of puzzles. But I really enjoy playing this game. Runs great on Samsung Vibrant and what's more important - it does not drain battery like action/shooter games.,5
This game really got me into Sudoku. It was a good way to keep busy and work that mind all in your palm.,4
for a FATD this was a great game. Loved the design and the daily puzzles to do - starting with 'piece of cake',5
"I have tried so many Sudoku games on paper, web and on my Android Tablet. I wanted to learn the game. I always enjoyed the easier games. But none of the other methods guided me like Enjoy Sudoku has. There are so many hints that I can ""hint"" my way through the most difficult Enjoy Sudoku has to offer. Each time I 'cheat' I learn more about methods to achieve a full correct grid.I didn't know until today that there was a paid version. I have been playing the free version all along. For all my enjoyment I bought the paid version and am still as happy with the results. There is no better game out there! I've tried! Maybe someday I will be able to call myself a Sudoku Master! ;)",5
Downloaded on my Motorola Xoom.  It's a lot of fun! Easy to use and I'm glad that it takes up the whole screen on my xoom!,5
"I've tried a few different Sudoku apps, but this one has great features (highlighting, flash on complete, auto-pencil for when you're stumped, etc) that I've not seen elsewhere and really like. It's never given me any trouble of any kind-- no force closes, nothing like that. A solid, simple app that gives good Sudoku.",5
"I've tried a number of Sudoku apps and never quite been satisfied until I played Enjoy Sudoku. It's got it all - consistent difficulty modes, intuitive and efficient interface, great highlighting, and an incredible hint/tutorial system. A great game for any skill level - it'll help and tutor you to discover all the complicated strategies if you get stuck.There is a free version where you can play the daily puzzle at each difficulty as a trial; the unlimited puzzle generation is awesome and well worth it.",5
"I grabbed this app when it was the free app of the day, and it's one that's certainly worth the price. The controls are intuitive, there's variety in difficulty, the highlighting is great (which you can turn off if you want), and the way hints are done is unique- they really are hints, and not just flat out giving you answers. They've actually helped me get better at sudoku in general. I love the autopencil settings- autoerase isn't a feature I'd seen elsewhere.",5
"This app provides ample sudoku puzzles at several levels (Picnic, Simple, Easy, Moderate, Intricate, Difficult, Annoying, Devious, Fiendish, Diabolical, Nightmare) of play.There are no ads, unobtrusive or otherwise. (C'mon guys- an ad is by definition obtrusive!)It has a simple, clean interface. The default for the ""Another"" button a new game at the same complexity level as the last one.It does not require network access in order to play.Best of all it runs on my Galaxy Tab 2 just as Amazon's compatability sidebar said it would. I have removed all the other sudoku games from my device, it's that good!",5
"this is the only sudoku game you will ever need. Play is responsive, have kept this app through three phone changes, Droid X, HTC thunderbolt, and now the Samsung galaxy s3, as well as my Samsung tablet. no issues, ever.",5
just fourteen words to sudoku lovers get it get it get it get it get it get it GET IT,5
"I had not downloaded any other version of sudoku until this one. Works great in tablet, screen flips portrait to landscape nicely. Teaches as you play.",5
"excellent for sudoku lovers at all levels, especially those past the easiest levels. this app has 16 levels each with new daily puzzles. a sophisticated hints feature helps puzzlers learn new techniques. only down side is that app requires internet access so it's worthless on an airplane.",5
I've tried a few different Sudoku apps and this one is by far the best. Has a great lay out and is very easy to use. Thanks!,5
"I've played this game on the iphone for a couple of years and tried most of the variations offered on their store.  The choices on the android have been limited however I never found this one until Amazon offered it today. I snapped it right up to try so I could offer a quick review.This is a great app for working these puzzles with several options you can switch on or off. I highly recommend it if you like these kinds of puzzles.My iphone app could take a picture of a puzzle in the newspaper and convert it to a playable game. I'd love to try that with the superior camera I have now but this app can't do that.  So, I went with 4 stars.",4
"Lots of options for difficulty, good help, purchased version can be used without an internet connection (for example, on an airplane).",4
This game gives you new puzzels daily at all different levels to keep you occuppied and mind active for quite a while if you play them all.,5
"I'd give it five stars but I'm not clever enough for anything beyond &#34;Moderate&#34;. You lose a star because I can't play half the levels. It ain't fair, I know, but, well... that are life.",4
I got this app as an Amazon Free App Of The Day and I am glad I did. It is the perfect thing when you find yourself with some free time on your hands and a desire to exercise your brain ;-),5
"I will actually play this until my eyes can no longer focus more than 2 feet away.  Granted, I'm getting older, so it doesn't take that long any more, but still.  This looks good on my phone (Galaxy S4), my Kindle Fire 8.9&#34; HDX, and my Galaxy Tab 2 7-inch.  It's very easy to use and even has instructions of what to look for.  If you like Sudoku, this is a great version.",5
This is the best Sudoku game ever. It teaches you the game from the ground up and has unlimited replay value. If you want to learn Sudoku or youre already an expert you should have this game.,5
quality app for a quality price... free!  its worth however much it cost regularly though.  great for beginners semi like my self.,5
"i love sudoku!! thank goodness it saves to SD card! this version has lots of levels and it keeps track of ur statistics which i edont need, but overall cool app!!",5
This app will teach you how to be a better sudoku player. It does this at your request and is not invasive during a game. It is my favorite sudoku app at this point.,5
"If you love sudoku, then this is the app for you. It teaches basic techniques through advanced techniques through the hint system. It can offer puzzles that can be solved without thinking too hard, and it generates puzzles much harder than anything you will ever see in a newspaper or magazine.With so many options and customizations available, I cannot help but recommend this app to anyone who truly enjoys sudoku.",5
"What else could you ask for? Easy to use, compact, pretty...this app is one of my favorites. Ah, there is one thing I would like: to totally silence the app I've found I need to turn off my ringer before opening the game AND silence the audio from within the app. Weird. Would be great if I could hit one button &amp; mute it all. Other then that - highly recommend!",5
"I'm new to Sudoku and I'm struggling to learn with more than leisure time purpose in mind. I'm dyslexic and have always found numbers and letters matrix difficult to follow.  I'll never overcome the problem but I hope to patch it up a bit.  This app has been a terrific aid in learning the Sudoku puzzles and although I still make a lot of mistakes I believe the game and this app have helped me.  BUT there is an annoying rating (or grading) page at the end of the puzzles that pops up and reminds me that some super duper whizz bang player/s completed the same puzzle in seven to ten percent of the time it took me and that sometimes dozens of others completed it in less than twenty percent of my time.  In my view Sudoku is like golf where the player's biggest opponent is the player him/her self.  A golfer completes a round and finishes first in a foursome only to have someone in the clubhouse announce ""that score stinks compared to the top finishers at ""The Masters"".  I realize this reads like sour grapes from a looser but like golf and other competitions the players take to the same fields of competition but the super players are only ranked against those of equal skill and talent.Other wise I rate this full five star app.",4
"No matter how hard they try, no other developer has come out with a better sudoku app.  I have tried several different ones and none beats Jason Linhart's Enjoy Sudoku.",5
I can't believe how Much fun sudoku is! this got me hooked and i won't be off it for a while,5
It helps you get better... excellent games... levels you will not see with other Sudoku implementations... just amazing. Definitely highly recommended.,5
Really awesome sudoku app! Even good for those of us who are not the world's greatest at this kind of puzzle!,5
"this makes about as much sense as the morons who gave this app a one star rating... personally i hate sudoku, but i hate idiot app reviewers more.  was just trying to balance out the stupidity.",5
"I have purchased quite a few Sudoku games over the years, but none of them compare to this one for easy of use and available features. Great game, I love it.",5
The Good:- 16 Difficulty levels- Smart Highlighting of numbers- Robust Hints system- Analytics to compare how well you did against othersThe Bad:- UI is a little clunky and out-dated- Some functions are not automated well enough. Minor issueThe Verdict: You will be hard pressed to find a more comprehensive and enjoyable sudoku game out there for Android. 4 out of 5 stars merely because the user interface could use some visual styling improvements.,4
"I've used many sudoku apps and enjoyed most of them, until I played Enjoy Sudoku. This is by far the best. The interface is enjoyable to use. The hint feature gives you just enough and allows you to ask for more. The best part of Enjoy Sudoku is the Learn button, which teaches you strategies to become a better player. Excellent app.",5
"I have used at least a half dozen sudoku apps (and even enjoyed some enough to give positive reviews). I tried the free version of this one first and was so impressed that I bought the paid version just because I believe the developer has earned it. The layout works well and you can customize the interface to work the way YOU want. That is nice. What sets this apart is the hint system. It's not about solving the puzzle you are working on, but learning HOW to solve so you can do it yourself in the future. When I first started using the app I was working (and struggling) at the Intricate difficulty level (there are 13 levels of difficulty - Intricate is 7th). Now I'm regularly working at Annoying (9th) and can make serious attempts at Devious (10) and Fiendish (11). I subscribe to the saying ""Give a man a fish, he eats for a day, teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime."" This app teaches you how to complete puzzles using the most advanced logic. Very highly recommended!",5
Havent tried all aspects of this game but like the fact that it teaches in detail how to solve each level and doesnt charge much time for a hint.,5
Love this app.  It is challenging and always available when I need it while traveling.  The levels are harder than rated which also make it a little more of a challenge than most books.,5
"Better than most if not all sudoku apps. Has many options, game of the day... some easy, others hard. I would recommend it to those who like sudoku!",5
"Never fails, always a challenge and fun.  Easy to download, update and upgrade; challenging on every level, proficiency and step.  Very good to keep ones brain current.",5
"I've played a lot of Sudoku apps, both on the Android and the iPad.  And so far, hands down, this is the best one.  I would have been willing to pick this one up for three bucks if I didn't already have it for free (yay, free Apps on Amazon).What I love about this more than the other apps is that you choose a number then the square you want to put it in.  Usually it is the opposite.  When you choose the number all the spots you've already chosen that number light up, making it easy to see if you are making a mistake or not.So, full marks for having something that is fun and challenging, giving a lot of options, and properly using all of the screen real estate to the best of its potential.  If you love Sudoku you HAVE to purchase this app.",5
"Easy to use, daily puzzles, and tons of difficulty levels. One of the few apps I use almost every day.",5
"Great app. Lots of levels and hints if you get stuck (doesn't just full in the answer, it teaches you why). Daily puzzles, random puzzles, or enter your own.",5
"My go to game on my Kindle.  The different levels of difficulty are perfect for my current skill levels.  Challenges my observation skills, keeps me thinking, keeps me out of my wifes' hair.  Ron",5
"I was a beta tester for a different devs sudoku, but this one blows that one away! Very well designed for us sudoku addicts! Thanks Jason!!!",5
Excellent sudoku app for all levels of experience. I applaud being able to stop all network access via the preferences.,5
"I have had the free version for over a year now.  I never bought it because one puzzle a day is plenty for me.  I think I tried every sudoku option out there on the market a couple of weeks ago because I was seeing if there was something better but didn't find anything that offers all the features this one does.  Although I will say sometimes the hint system doesn't explain the strategy as well as I would like (When it teaches you what to look for).Oh, and I just found out its compatible with my Xoom...excellent!",5
"This Android game is the best, smoothest, quickest sudoku game engine I've ever used.  It is better than any I've used in a browser or as a download game on my computer.It includes 3 tutorial lessons, and then 13 different skill levels.It compares your times to those of many other players to show you how you're doing, statistically.You can use ""Hint"" > ""Check Entries"" at any time without penalty --it won't respond with ""Everything is just fine,"" until you've entered all of the essential pencil marks-- or else you can take advantage of their graduated hint system or automatic pencil marks.You can also enter the given digits of a printed puzzle in order to solve it within this game.You don't have to have Internet access at the time you are playing:  you can play while your phone is in ""airplane mode"".",5
Great app for the price.  Works as expected without any problems.  I am happy with the performance ont he kindle fire.,5
"Jason's Sudoku is the best of the best. More than a game, it can teach you all the pro strategies too.",5
I love this game.  I have tries others and I like the way this one shows you all.of the number placements.  the hints are great too,5
"Sudoku is always a favorite but the way this one is set up makes it even better.  All the little extras attached to each game like letting you know when a wrong move was made, when you have successfully gotten a series of numbers, etc. make it a joy to play.  And the skill levels can't be beat.  If you are in the mood for an easy relaxing game, or a real mind bender and anything in between, this has it all.",5
"great product - should be 10 stars.  I love this!!!  It is intuitive and easy to use.I like how the screens are laid out, with the big numbers for entries and little numbers for entering 'pencil marks'.They have a great product here.  It is obviously well designed and tested.I will look for more products from this company.If you like Sudoku you have to get this!",5
Spend far too much time on this. Game play very natural. Have to wonder about 90% who are always faster :-),5
"Enjoy sudoku is a great, challenging, fun distraction for beginners and up. It is a must have for sudoku fans.",5
I love the game. Several levels available to play. The best thing about this app is that is it playable on all the Kindle fires.,5
I was thrilled that I could get this for android.  I miss the crazy random character/color puzzle though!  Be aware you can get the full set of daily puzzles for free with no ads.  The paid just feeds the addiction.  Ilove it.  You'll never need another one.,5
"I used to watch people on the subway intently zone out on their sudoku puzzles. I never quite understood the draw, so this review is that of a sudoku rookie. With that in mind I love this app. I have used it everyday since installing. One feature I really enjoy are the vocabulary lessons, and the wide range of skill levels. This is a well designed app, with no strange permissions and the price to entertainment ratio is great.",5
"I used the free version of this for quite some time before spending the money on this. I absolutely love this sudoku app. Very intuitive controls, many features that make the game easier to play but don't take the challenge out of the game. A lot of personalization options allow everyone to play how they are most comfortable. Definitely worth the money to be able to play more than one of each level every day.",5
"This is the best Sudoku app, hands down!  I love this app! Great setup, user friendly, easy on the eyes, and customizable.  Works perfectly on my Samsung Galaxy SII Epic 4G Touch and my Kindle Fire.",5
"Nice Sudoku app.  Pretty hard to make a sudoku app that doesn't generic, but they went the extra mile and put in an incredibly detailed tutorial/help section to help noobs like myself understand some of the more sophisticated Sudoku moves.  I personally think the home screen looks a little cheezy, but that'd a pretty superficial reason to scratch a point off.  I guess I'm superficial.",4
"A very, very good way to pass the time......  This is an excellent app that goes from easy to just about &#34;no way to beat it.&#34;",5
"I've tried a few different suduko apps but this one is by far the best of the bunch. Keeps the brain working and when the brain can't any more, the hints don't give away the answer, you still have to work a little bit for it.",5
"Definitely grab this today if you have any interest in a sudoku app. There's plenty of them around, some that are free. But this one is by far the best i've used. I can't say that it's worth $3 for everyone, as i'm not personally a hardcore sudoku guy. But really, the tutorials really make this worth it. The hard puzzles are actually challenging. Theres no shortage of puzzles. The highlighting system rocks, as well as the best hinting system i've seen..I need a lot of hints ^_^ so I very much appreciate the attention to detail there. The main menu doesn't look like anything special, but the actual board is clean and clear. Nice job, and definitely worth the money for people who love sudoku. Enjoy!Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)",4
"I play sudoku in a magazine and on my Kindle. 2 previous games were more tedious to use. One occassionally fouled up so that I couldn't even finish the game. This one has 2-3 options for how to use the pencil mark and guess for a square. It also has several helps, which I have an option to use or not at my preference. I do like the option for the software to tell me if there are errors and then if I want them fixed, I tell it to fix, but I don't have to. I also like that when I am working on 7's (for example) all of the sevens on the board are highlighted and all of the 7 pencil marks are also highlighted. This adds another level of testing for accuracy and guessing.",5
Good choice of game levels and easy to use,5
"Great puzzles, the different levels are very consistent, and the learn feature has taught me more about how to master Sudoku than I would have playing with pencil and paper.",5
"This game is very enjoyable and it can be very challenging. What I really like about It is that it helps a great deal in learning to play Sudoku correctly. There is a very good tutorial included.  I have only played the free game so far, but I am going to buy the paid version right now!! You should get this if you want to learn how to play the correct way, instead of guessing sometimes.  It is also pretty easy to understand. I have tried many of the Sudoku games out there, but this is by far the best!!!",5
"For anyone who does alot of sudoku there are probably too many features missing. Lacks a way to invert the currently entered values, cant automatically detect pencil input when inputting multiple values into the same cell.It does have a nice interface but the gameplay needs some work.",2
I love that in this version of the game if you get stuck and request a hint it actually gives you a real hint of where you should concentrate your attention not simply filling a random tile for you. It helps you to solve it but doesn't necissarily do all the work for you. Droid X,5
"For playing sudoku, this is a good game - a nice variety of difficulty levels, and an unlimited supply of games (in practical terms, at least).For me where this shines is in the hints.  I've been playing Astraware Sudoku (on another platform) for years, and on the highest difficulty levels, always got to a point where I guessed which number an open pair represented with pencilmarks, backtracking if I picked the wrong number.  With Enjoy, I'm using the hints to learn how to use logic tricks instead of guesswork.",5
"I've tried several other Sudoku apps, but this is the one I'll be keeping.  Lot's of levels to choose from.  Love the stats you get after you've finished.  Good hint system.  You can set bookmarks for when you just need to guess.  Lots of other options too.  Auto pencil, etc.  Great Sudoku game.  Gotta' go - it's calling me...",5
"Definitely my favorite Sudoku I have ever played.  Between the scoring, the statistics, and the random games, this application is above reproach.",5
"Love this program - I can play at any level as many times a day as I want.  Love the hints, and the explanations.  I have improved my sudoku playing because of this program.  Thanks.",5
"My Kindle was cumbersome to take on a Doctor visit, so downloaded this to my Samsung Galaxy S4. Ticked away the time in the waiting room quite nicely.",5
"With as many skill levels that are available, even the most addicted and professional Sudoku player can find their challenge. I like finding out how I did after playing the game and this one tells you your percentile rank compared to others who played that same game, without using hints or if you used hints. I have played many electronic versions of Sudoku over the years but this is the best one there is.",5
"I've tried five or six sudoku apps, with varying degrees of satisfaction. I review here Enjoy Sudoku (ES) for the KF.Enjoy Sudoku is one of the best board-type game applications I've ever seen, across all forms of games, across several platforms.The display is beautiful. I typically play with my KF in portrait position. I've tried landscape; it works perfectly, but it's just not to my taste. The highlighting of completed row/box is useful. Highlighting ""all number N used"" is extremely helpful, but having the display flash in different colors takes a bit of getting used to.The user controls are OK:- Entering choices using the box-first approach is intuitive. Entering number-first-then-box is claimed to be faster, but again, it takes some getting used to. (Because of the highlighting feature, I've not been able to get used to it because of the way the colors change back and forth.)- The undo/back-track command is really great. I haven't yet found how deep the undo stack is, but I've exercised it pretty well, I think.- I've used the rotate/mirror commands only once, but the change of viewpoint enabled me to finish a ""fiendish"" (toughest level) puzzle. Bravo.- I have yet to figure out what other command buttons do - from my perspective, ES behaves just a tad strangely when some buttons are pressed. I suppose I should read the manual, but a perfect app is written so all controls are intuitive.A truly strong point of ES is the range of available daily games: there are FOURTEEN levels, ranging from trivial to, well, really really (near impossibly) hard. Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There is a slight discontinuity in difficulty: the game takes a big jump somewhere around ""moderate"" or ""intricate."" I can live with that. Starting over doesn't impact time-to-complete scoring (I'm divided on this one).At the end of a game, you get some feedback with a rough percentile chart. Sorta informative. It would be nicer if there was an absolute ranking; ""User_name is 483 of 10 zillion"" could be rewarding to players.I really recommend this app to KF owners.",5
"There isn't much I can say that isn't already apparent from the insanely high ratings this app has. More options, better difficulties, better scoring, better implementation, better puzzles, and the best tutorial I've ever seen. Even the hints are great and helpful without giving away too much.",5
"This is the best sudoku app on the market, bar none. Unlimited puzzles. A great hint system. In-depth help for those times when you need to know the difference between a X-wing and a XY-wing. Great fun! A+++",5
it is a waste of money&bull;it is like the titanic/you get it and it is so much fun but then it starts to sink so do no get it the. it works yes or no go down to find the clue.  you are hear and it is nnnnnnnno!!!!&iquest;,1
"This game is definately worth the money and more.  It not only allows you to have fun playing but also has a good selection of strategies to use to solve the more difficult puzzle.  I am somewhat new to this game so the tutorial and the ""learn"" feature on this game is really good.  I also like the statistics regarding how quickly you solved the puzzle versus others who have played the same puzzle.",5
"Top rate sudoku app.  Tons of difficulty options, highly customizable appearance, built in enclopedia with great examples that have helped improve my game. Highly recommended.",5
"this app is well made, well designed, solid, and without any flaws. I been downloading free app of the day amazon apps for while now and this is definitely one of the better ones! Perfect for all skill levels and can really help out beginners!!",5
Best one I've come across. Nothing else to say. 5 stars for sure. Fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty,5
"Love it!! I'm new to Sudoku, and this made learning to play simple and entertaining. I also really liked learning the history of the game inside the app. Really great customization as well; I love the color and background options, sounds, and that you can mark your puzzle just as if you were playing on paper. Excellent app!",5
"Enjoy Sudoku is easy to use and has a lot of difficulty levels, but it's not the best sudoku app out there. I prefer Andoku Sudoku, free on the Android market.",3
Great game. Ignore all the nonsense reviews from free app day. I am surprised they take the time to write twenty words.,5
"Well... it's the tilt that really counts but if you feel like shaking your tablet/phone... you're the one who paid for it :)I posted a few reviews of Android apps and this game, I believe, it's the first app that gets a 5 stars from me. Not because it's perfect - the resolution on my XOOM could be higher and the game is not as responsive to tilting the tablet as it should be - but because I just love playing it. It's got a definite retro, arcade feeling and, unlike something that you could have played back in the late 80's/early 90's, it responds to your gadget's accelerometer. And, with unlimited ammo, missiles and lots more surprises, it's just plain, no apologies fun.I got mine as the free Amazon 'app of the day' but it's worth the admission price from anyone looking for a simple but fun arcade game.P.S. - the game allows for 'keyboard' controls and I was in fact able to play it off a bluetooth keyboard paired with my tablet but why would anyone want to do that? It's easier to score because you're a lot more accurate but it's not as much fun as the tilting or accelerometer mode.",5
it is a lot of fun but it is a lot harder than it should be. cant pass level 3 on easy.,2
Decent game.  The controls are a bit challenging as it&apos;s based on tilting the phone to move and tapping on buttons on the bottom right to fire.  Not bad but not great.  To the people who rate it low b\/c it&apos;s not free yet wait a bit and grow up.  Don&apos;t rate low without trying it first.  I wouldn&apos;t pay more than .99 cents for it but it&apos;s worth a try since it&apos;s free.,4
I couldn't get into this game so I deleted it. Someone else may like it though so it depends on what you are into..,2
"It's very good. Good graphics, control, etc. That being said, I find myself getting bored of it quickly. Not much replay value from what I can tell.",4
controls are really bad. seems like no matter how you move the phone it just goes where it wants. gfx are decent. wouldnt recommend payin for it,2
"Works very well, but have noticed that I do not use it much any more.  Very good app. I would download again.  Thanks!",5
"I haven&apos;t reviewed an Amazon app in a while, but this one definately deserves some great feedback. Controls may use the g sensor, but it couldn&apos;t be more well done. Love how the weapons systems work too. A+, finally got a game that holds my attention. Thanks Amazon!",5
"Has potential, but needs an overhaul to the controls, feels sluggish in general. Also, seems a little low res, like the graphics are being stretched quite a bit. Entertaining, but not worth the price at this point.",3
"Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6There are tons of side scrolling shooters out there, and Overkill is just one of them.  Boasting superior graphics and sound always attracts my attention, so I snatched up this title as soon as I could.On my little Epic, I was able to kick in all the eye candy Overkill offered and still maintain over 50 frames per second.  Everything was very smooth, not a single glitch or hiccup.  I even enabled the fast load option and didn't encounter an issue.  Everything was nicely detailed and crystal clear.  Very, very nice.  On the gTablet, things didn't fare so well.  Averaging 45 frames per second, everything did work, and worked just as smoothly as it did on the Epic, but the graphics were *so* not superior.  They are all fuzzy and lacking detail.  I toggled every option in every combination possible and still they barely entered medicore range. Sorry guys, try again.  As for the sound, yeah, it's pretty good.  Clear sound effects and a good background soundtrack.On both my devices, the accelerometer control was dead on perfect.  I like that Overkill recalibrates at the beginning of each level, adjusting itself to how you're holding the device at the time.  This allows you to to play the game in pretty much any position you want.  In game recalibration is also there, to give you a chance to fix things up if they aren't to your liking.  Doing some good thinking, Overkill's dev also put in sensitivity adjustment, which will allow the game to be adjusted to the device and gamer's preferred style of play.  Keyboard/touchscreen controls worked just as well, with nary a missed movement or sluggish response.  Sorry, I don't own a Zeemote, so I was unable to test this function.The game itself is what I would consider a complete title.  Besides running through a storylined campaign mode, there is is a test mode, quick mission mode, and survival mode, all of which extend the replay level.  Multiple difficulty levels can be played, with the difficulty level factored into your score.  The computer AI's lines are only slightly cheesy, and often humorous.  As is typical with games of this genre, weapons upgrades are available and new weapon types appear at different parts of the games.  A complete help section is built in, with links back to the dev's site for yet more information.  Gameplay is action packed, with no laggy spots.  The one thing I don't particularly care for, besides the less than stellar graphics on the tablet, is the use of the screen real estate.  In general, I think all the objects are too big, giving the gameplay a cramped feeling.With all that praise, why only three stars?  Simple - if you're going to make a lot of hoopla about the graphics and don't deliver, that's a double negative for me.  Get that fixed up, and it's a 4-5 star title.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/question",3
"This game reminds me of its name sake, the major difference is that this one is a side scrolling display whereas the original was a top down scrolling game. Enjoyable to play on the Incredible. Not a game that is over engrossing, but is fun.",5
"Gameplay pretty good, controls good to. Wish games graphics were better, but however it reminds me of my DOS games I&apos;ve played years ago.",4
"Motorola Atrix with android 2.3.4: im no serious gamer, I never did well with games that required intense hand eye coordination. This game reminds me of LifeForce from original Nintendo days. \nFor those wary of the bluetooth access, I believe its for pairing up external device pads like a keyboard or scrolling device. There are options as to what you can use as a controller.",4
The gave had decent graphics and a nice upgrade system.  The controls are bad. You can do motion but the response is slow out hand and then you can&apos;t see the ship,2
"I picked it up as the deal of the day from Amazon, so I couldn't go wrong.  I don't know that I would have paid for it, but for a free game, it holds entertainment value.  I have since deleted it and haven't looked back.",3
"The game worked well but honestly, it was a bit boring.  Maybe if I was in the doctor's office and its the only game I had, sure, I'd play it.  But the objects on screen seem too big.  Controls do work, but that isn't saying much when all you have is a touch screen or the acceleromitor.  I uninstalled it.",2
"Why the heck do people rate games based on whether or not its free or on what they think it should cost? Rate them based on game play, graphics, controls, storyline, length etc. Do Not give a bad rating because your a spoiled brat and think $2 is too much for a video game. Or because your phone is not up to par to handle the install. Just because other games are free doesn&apos;t mean ones that cost a couple dollars suck. Ingrates!",3
"When it comes to app reviews, I find it hard to do them.  I am app crazy so I am downloading them from the android market as well as amazon's.  I am always looking for cool new ideas or some cool new gadget.  If I don't like it, it does not stay on my phone.  That being said, I have downloaded this app, but I do not recall why I no longer use it.  So I know it sucked or I would still have it lol.  If its free give it any app a shot.  But if you have to pay for this PASS, PASS, PASS and then PASS again.",1
"The game looks like it could be fun, but it force closes just before the game begins. HTC Inspire 4G",2
"I think the controls are a little wonky, but once I got used to it I found that I really enjoy this one. Kinda hard for me, but that&apos;s not a knock against the game. Only reason I rated 4 is that it&apos;s not nearly as good as my favorite mobile game (PvZ), so I couldn&apos;t put it on the same level. But really solid game!",4
"It has decent graphics and the sound doesn't get on your nerve in a hurry. The controls are pretty responsive. I normally don't like games where the controls are handled by the accelerometer, but I think I liked this one because it auto-shoots so that is one less thumb being constantly on the screen. Which probably isn't necessary on a tab but it sure is nice on my cell phone which already has limited enough real estate.Worked great on my EVO 3D without any problems.",4
"I liked the graphics and sound. It was a really well done game. However, I just couldn&apos;t find a control scheme that worked for me. Using the touch screen to move the ship stopped me from seeing some of the screen and using accelerometer was awkward for left to right movement.",3
this _is a game and it is so wacky i must say hamburger choo choo train ... chugga chuga choo CHOOO! ALL ABOARD!!!!!!!,1
"I love when they use the pixels to make a the pictures!\nNo, seriously, great game, visually refreshing, but controlling on a phone just doesn&apos;t seem as tight as I&apos;d like for a rail shooter. Great for R-Type fans. Yay free-ness!\nWait... am I First? Wow... never been, guess I should say something...",4
"Simple game, but a lot of fun just like flying-shooting-side-scrollers should be. Not a lot of depth to the story, but there doesn&apos;t need to be. Highly recommended.",5
"Good graphics, music, sound, controls (hold your phone while level is loading the way you want to hold it while playing - it recalibrates each time). Bluetooth permissions are for Zeemote options, which app summary doesn&apos;t mention. Good overall, and even better for free!",4
Overall a good game. Needs an option to control sensitivity. More weapons would be nice too. And I wouldn&apos;t complain if it were zoomed out a bit,4
I got a free zeemote and searched for games that used it thus game is fun as heck... its not pretty it is definitely fun,3
"I was sitting in class with nothing else to do, but to download a game to play while i wait for the class to end.",3
Thank you to who ever decided to make this free app of the day this game is what I call fun n a sweet lil time killer the only thing like some have said already is that the controls suck im kinda getting use to useing my phone to control my ship but still a bit n the game is also a bit hard even on easy thank you again,4
I love this kind of game and this one is well done. Just a little hard on easy. Very fun game.,4
"I really wanted to like this app. It works great on my Thunderbolt, the music is fine, the graphics are sweet and fluid, and the gameplay is all I had hoped for from a side scroller. The controls petty much killed it for me, though: no matter what you do, the ship lags behind where you tell it to go, and that means you don't shoot the targets, and you eat the incoming bullets.Trusting the life of my little ship and its crew to the accelerometer is as bad an idea as one would expect, but the only other option is to cloak your ship with your finger: an act that does little to hide you from the enemies, but does a fair job of obscuring your view, making this difficult and annoying to play. And at the end of the day, those at not words to describe a game that will keep me coming back for more. Which is sad, because it has everything else going for it.",3
"I really wanted to like this game.  I love side scrollers and space shooters and the graphics are very nice.  But,  I find the controls completely unplayable.  The touch controls lag terribly and then inexplicably my ship starts moving wildly from top to bottom while my finger is still in the middle smashing into everything until Game Over.  If they fix the controls,  this might be a great game.",3
"I love the concept of this game, it is very fun to play.  It reminds me of some classic arcade games (can't think of their names off the top of my head) and has some cool modern elements to it.  It is challenging, and not just because the controls are tough.  It takes a little while to figure out what is going on in the game, but the learning curve isn't too steep.  They give you three control options.  First is tiling the screen to use the accelerometer to control the ship.  This is extremely difficult, though novel, and might be a good way to do it if you're used to it.  The second way is by using the touchscreen, which is a little finicky, and can be challenging when your fingers are in the way of your view, but they worked the best for me.  The third is to use some sort of controller (Wii-mote maybe?) which would probably be ideal, but I haven't gotten around to trying that yet.  I knocked a point off for the controls, otherwise would be perfect to me.  Plays well on my Motorola Atrix.",4
"I had no problems, was fun to play on my G2not shur why other people are having problems with the controls",4
"on sprint evo, freezes won&apos;t get past 1st lvl, just flies forever with nothing to shoot :( uninstall too bad 1st lvl is fun",2
"Everything about this game appeals to me except for the controls. I generally don&apos;t like motion control but I gave it a fair shot before switching to the option where you control the ship movement with your finger. That was disastrous. For one thing, you can&apos;t see the ship because your finger completely covers it. That wouldn&apos;t be too horrible, but the nail in the coffin was very poor responsiveness in this mode. \nToo bad, really. I think they did a fine job making a great looking side scrolling space shooter, but ultimately if you&apos;re like me, you won&apos;t like using motion control in this format. \n2. 5 stars",3
I havea nootered nook and tried this game. Works perfectly on the nook. controls are not reversed and it does not loon stretched out. My son will love this game,4
"It&apos;s a good little game, looks good and the level system is done well, star blitz is a lot better for a space shooter",5
Nothing special here. Not the most responsive side scroller out there or innovative. I uninstalled this app pretty quickly after a few days.,3
"Controls are super wacky and pretty much do this game in. I couldn&apos;t play properly with the accelerometer, it calibrates while the game loads up so I&apos;m assuming it got f&apos;d up somewhere along the way. No big deal, I changed the settings to use the touchscreen to control the ship. It seemed to work alright at first, but it progressively got worse as the game went on. With all the hassles of trying to simply play the game, I just couldn&apos;t enjoy it.",1
I&apos;m having trouble with the controls even after calibrating mid-game. Dying several times when my ship races to the lower right of the screen is not entertaining.,3
"Reviewed on HTC Thunderbolt & Asus TransformerNice game decent graphics in the 2d side shooter genre, think old school Defender with a few differences.On the Thunderbolt, I found the controls to be resposive and the gameplay smooth and challenging. Decent graphics, several game modes, and challenging gameplay make for a fun game.I noticed in the description it said it was redesigned to support tablets, so I expected HD graphics or improved controls or something, I did not see any optimization on my Transformer running Honeycomb 3.2, the 3.2 software sizes the game to fill the screen resulting in less resolution and stretched graphics for apps that aren't optimized for tablets. This appeared to be the case with this game.So the look wasn't optimized, next to check controls.Upon attempting to play the game using the acceleometer, I found that it was wanting me to control it as though it were in portrait mode but was in landscape, thereby making it unplayable using that method. Next I used screen control method with better results but found the controls using this method difficult although playable on a 10.1 inch screen. So, unless I'm missing another tablet version of this game, it definitely isn't optimized and is barely playable at least on Asus Transformers. As it is only ""redesigned to support"" tablets and only optimized for the Galaxy  Tab (really, why only that one?), I guess I couldn't expect too much, but most games are playable with 3.2, I don't know how the controls could get messed up so much, but I digress.So bottom line, this was great on my Thunderbolt, ran perfectly, but for a supposedly ""tablet supported"" game it failed badly on my Transformer, so if that's all you have to use apps on, I'd skip this for now.Anyhow, as long as you aren't buying this for your Transformer it's a good game, at $2 it's higher than most, and I'm not sure I'd pay more than a buck, but it is a good game overall and if you like Defender type games you'll like this.Feel free to comment but know that Amazon will not allow me to reply. Long story, but basically, if I were you I wouldn't reply to any of the troll reviews or correct others misconceptions, Amazon will ban you for criticising others reviews. Its a lifetime ban so there you go.",4
"Good game.  Plays well on the Iconia A500.  If anything, I&apos;m sick off all the BS about permissions.  Get over it!!  Go buy an iCrud if you can&apos;t deal with it, you big babies.",3
"it gets 4 stars. one for working and no glitches, one for amazing graphics, one for good side scroller, and one for small footprint. it loses one star for being too hard on easy.",4
"Great game. Side scroll shooter with upgrades to your ship and can change ships. Also has a nice little story to go along with the action. Great time waster. Pretty sure bluetooth permissions are for a bluetooth joystick listed in the settings. Imo nothing suspicious about permissions. Would pay 1.99, great that it was free though.",4
"Screen controls are a little weird being there are no joysticks, but instead you drag where you want to go. There is absolutely a learning curve, but graphics, gameplay, and customization make up for the difference in controls.",3
"cool little 2d shooter, like the old school vibe it has going. good time killer. oh to the person who asked why it needed bluetooth premissions, thats probably fkor the zii-mote that you can use to play the game. never used it, but like i said thats probably why it needs that permission.\n\nbottom like good free app of the day, download only if you like little time killer games.\n\nruns good on G2",5
"Decent graphics and game play.Error pops up each time game is launched, and appears to launch three copies.  Error message: There was an error with this application. Please download from the Amazon app store again.After exiting program, the android application launcher force closes and no icons will reappear until the game is installed.",1
I downloaded this for my Asus tablet and the accelerometer and touch screen controls weren&apos;t very good.  My ship kept bouncing up and down like a low rider.,1
"no longer works. always crashes when I try to play. it loads fine, for the menus.on HTC rezound phone. used to work on my droid 2.",2
After I got 1230pts it stopped doing anything but scrolling for next 10 minutes and level never finished. restarted and it repeated at just over 1000.,2
"This was a free app of the day so I looked into it for my Kindle Fire. I enjoy word games, etc and this is a different way to use your brain to come up with words. I told my aunt about it and she loves Word Collapse as well.  Granted it is not the hardest or most challenging word game but it is most definately a different word game to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys word games and does not mind having one that is not difficult when you just need to play something to clear your mind.",5
"Exactly what I said. This game is alright, and has good quality and really is what it says in the description, but it doesn't really have anything special, or truly entertaining. Wouldn't pay for it, but I bought it when it was the free app of the day.",3
"I wouldn't play it all the time because.it isn't challenging enough.  I play Words With Friends, its much better. Little kids will like it.",2
"This is a pretty fun game to play, especially if you like word games!!  This is also a great game to help kids learn to spell!",4
"Enjoyable word game but would prefer the capability to move to the SD card.  Hence, my decision to give 4 stars.  It would also be nice to be able to have a high score screen, a la Bejeweled2, rather than just single personal best.",4
so happy to get this as a faotd!  thanks amazon!  Great fun and not too difficult if you don't want it to be.  My 9 y/o Honor student loves the unscramble feature.  I love the timed games.  My 5 y/o is learning to spell and likes that he can use an app that grownups use!,5
"I expected this to be an addictive app, but to wasn't. Which is a good thing. I enjoy playing it on occasion when I need a break.",3
its not bad for faotd. remindsme of bookworm but easier as you can form words with any tiles on the board.,4
"Its a good game. I just got it and it is really fun! I have been playing it and the option where you get to pick what you want, I chose the one where you get to spell the words yourself. It is my favorite. You should get this game because it is educational for people of all ages.",5
You are so pathetic Superman........I agree with the others.... We need an option to move to a sd card... I think the concept is interesting.... But to much room.,5
"i have to say,this app is so fun!i could spend hours playing it.the graphics are great and thevgame plays very well on my kindle fire.",5
Great for learning new words. Lots of levels makes it challenging and fun to play. It also runs smoothly unlike some other games.,5
"This is a fun and entertaining game.  Spelling is strengthened for all ages.  I enjoy playing the game as well as the children.  thinking up words is a great process for the mind, young and old....I really like it.",5
"Superman I love you, I think you are absolutely hilarious! Your Story about the star wars movie still has me laughing haha you need to start a blog and post all the funny random reviews on there, you would have so many followers! Happy Valentines Day :) I think this is a great idea of a game. Free app of the day, faotd, download, developer, idea, fantastic, amazon, game.",5
"So far, I like it. The three different games and multiple levels means there is lots of variety and it can be played regardless of whether I'm in a competitive mood or a lazy one. Because of the variety, all three of my kids can play it, too. So, definitely a win :)",4
"This app is not for me and it did not gave me any fun at all, in fact it was boring for me, but it is not buggy it is lightweight and it is small, if word games are your thing then you may like this app",4
"Although the dictionary has some limitations and doesn't recognize some technical or esoteric words, this game is very enjoyable. Bear in mind that the dictionary is self contained and isn't eating your data allotment, which is a good thing IMHO. Definitely on my 'keep installed' short list.",4
Three ways to play and many levels of difficulty make this a great game to play over and over.Really gets your brain going and tests/enhances your vocabulary.Works well on my Samsung Exhibit II.,5
Judging by the reviews I couldn't tell whether this game sucked of not. After playing a round with no problems it seems like a fun game. 4 stars for now.,4
"fun game, but needs a better dictionary. apparently &quot;apartment&quot; isnt a word, among others that ive tried to use but didnt count.",3
wordhero is much better and its free and multiplayer. this is boring - I should be able to drag instead of tap.  will uninstall.  signed - a superman fan,1
"Nice game.  Can make words using ""any"" of the letters, in any order--not only diagonally, straight across, or up/down.  Timed mode is the most challenging.",4
"I was interested in this game, but unfortunately I'm still using the original Motorola Droid and can't afford the space. I wish the developers were more sensitive to space issues... we need the ability to move apps to the SD ram.",1
The same as Word Smith this is relaxing because I like word game keeps my mind busy and exercised during my busy day,5
this is one of my favorite word games on the tablet. It keps me busy and kills alot of time.I recommend this one. There a re a few different ways to play so that youcan change it up if you want. I love it.,5
"The concept is fun and the game can be challenging, but after finishing a level, i was left with a feeling of &quot;what now?&quot; It just ends. Sure, you can replay of choose a different mode, but I just wanted levels to beat or something.",3
"This app I would have definitely rated 5 stars if not for the inability to move it to the SD card or keep an internal score.  This app has almost no permissions, which is GREAT.  So what reason it has to be stationed on the internal storage is a mystery.  It's not a critical utility app that may require it to load on the boot, nor does it contain a widget.... so WHY?  Why ruin an otherwise very decent, low-permissions app with that horrible oversight?  And I'm very happy to not see social networking components like Feint in the app, but is there any good reason not to at least keep internal scoring and add a permission to write to the SD for that purpose?  I'm shaking my head on why this developer wouldn't do these two simple things to make the app more valuable.  The gameplay was great.  I had no problems with boredom and the like.  I don't need to be entertained by little birds perched on wire that fly away when you select a letter.  This app is clearly for adults looking for content rather than primarily ""graphic bling.""  One other suggestion:  Lose the italics.  Word game people who like to play for extended periods of time of more than 10 minutes will begin to find the italic print irritating and not as easy for the eyes to adjust to.If the italics are removed, internal scoring is added, and it gets moved to the external SD, I'll be back to happily change this rating to a 5-star one.  Til then, I have to chalk its tire and tell it to move along, with a 1-star citation for parking itself on my phone's No Parking Zone.",1
"Fun for downtime, easy enough for midde school kids to play. It was just what I was looking for, not so easy that I get bored but not so hard my kids can't play.",4
People love making variations on word games. Here is yet another one where you try to make words out of a bunch of letters. If you like word games this one isn't too bad.,4
"It's a bit like playing Bookworm with the challenge and personality removed. Words can be made regardless of whether or not the touch. It's too easy and never becomes engaging.It's better than the plethora of anagram games. But, the game needs challenge and a hook to bring you back for more.",3
"This little word game has enough options and variety to make it a very nice challenge.  It is very simple to learn and you can easily end up spending hours challenging yourself to flex your vocabulary ""muscles"".The app takes up less than 1 MB of space on my Kindle Fire (which doesn't have or need a SD card) so I didn't lower my rating becasue of the size of the game.I would give it 5 stars except for the lack of a multiple player mode.  I think it would be even more fun if you could have the added challenge of an opponent.  Maybe they will add that option to the game, but in the meantime it is worth a try if you are at all fond of word-related games.  A very good FAOTD choice.",4
"I see that this game has an average of ""Four Stars"" for it's reviews...and I agree with that.It's a solidly built word game with several modes that is fun to play in short spurts.  I don't think I would really enjoy it for a marathon gaming session, but in a few minutes waiting at the dentist, it's good fun.Overall, there's not really much negative to say about the app.",4
I like this word game and thought it is fun to play. I also like that it has three modes of playing so if you get tired of one you just change over. You can turn off the clock for relaxed playing so you are just having fun trying to build the biggest words you can.All three modes are entertaining and are a bit of a brain tease. The game worked well on my Kindle Fire and the graphics were OK.,5
"I'm a word game junkie, and I really enjoy all of the games in this app. My only complaint, however, is the absence of a hint option in the word scramble game. Not proud that I sometimes can't figure it out, but it would be nice if there was an option to see what word I was too shtoopid to figure out on my own. ;-)",4
First its a good game but i don't like the controls the fact that i gotta tap the green arrow every time to summit a word gets old why not a double tap on the last latter of the word i wanna summit.,3
"I love word games. I was happy to see this one as the FAOTD, especially since most of what has been offered lately have been kid games, and it's nice to see something for us grown-ups! Word Collapse has far exceeded my expectations. I like the variety of game modes, and especially like the Untwist one. Lots of fun! Good choice, Amazon!",5
not bad but got bored pretty fast at least this is better than yesterday faotd bag it which i found stupid in certain aspects,3
HP TOUCHPAD w/ICS CM9 Android 4.0.4Have never been able to get game to load once installed -  immediately Force Closes.  Have tried on every build of CM9 and no luck.,1
I love word games...But this one isn't very challenging. I cant see why it wouldn't be free in the first place.,3
"The white tiles glare too much.  Softer tones would be nice.  Even though there is plenty of variety, I prefer Bird Is The Word.  It's just more aesthetically pleasing.",3
"This game it's pretty fun, but its dictionary it's pretty limited. It wouldn't let me spell the word cytoplasm, and a few others. I don't know about you but I get frustrated when I'm playing a game where you have to get rid of as many letters as possible and it just won't let you. Sorry but I'm going to go ahead and uninstall because this is more frustrating than fun.",2
"I got this app as the free one of the day and it was a great ""buy."" The timed levels require you to really think on your feet. Nice app for wasting time.",3
"This app contains 3 word games. However, as others have mentioned, there don't seem to be levels. Each game is scored, but high scores aren't saved anywhere. Also, unlike other word games, exiting the app ends the current game, rather than pausing it for later. That is my biggest concern. I like to go in and out of games over the course of days.As it is, it's ok for free. I wouldn't pay full price until they updated this app with some basic features.",3
this game has lots of replay value: 3 unique modes of play and 4 levels of difficulty per mode. LOVE this game!! and I'm rather picky about my word games... get it while it's the FAotD! worth the 2 bucks though...,5
"I like this app. I like looking up words and seeing how fast I can find them.If you like finding words, you will like this App.",4
"I thought it would be something similar to scramble with friends...its like the same thing.....((:  its a cool game,and reading the other reviews,I thought it was like scrabble or something like that..give it a try;it's free for the day!!:D.  -02/15/12 (Wednesday)",4
"first two modes are far too easy.the third mode is enjoyable, but the collapse aspect adds nothing to the gameplay. in fact, i find it distracting.level end noise is too loud, though in level sounds are fine. i don't care for level end graphic, but other art is nice.i got this as a free app of the day and it was worth the download to try it out, but i think i will be deleting in order to clear up some room.",3
"...just not great either.  Glad it was the faotd, otherwise I would never have known how long it would have taken to download, play, and uninstall this little gem. Not much of a challenge, with almost nothing to make out stand out in the already over crowded sub-category of word games.",3
Great fun.  Runs fast on my little android. Three simple games that test ones word power. Complex words give better points.  The timed challenge changes the strategy.  Thanks.,5
"This really make you concentrate and focus.  Not sure about all the words in its database, but for the most part it's fun.",5
I really like this game very fun and entertaining. It is very addictive and challenging at times. I give it 5 stars,5
This is a ice game to kill some down time. My 11 year old grandaughter likes it and plays when she visits. It is challanging and fun.,5
"due to the lack of Superman75's first-on-the-scene review I was forced to download this app completely unwarned about what dangers may befall me or my family upon its use.  I am constantly looking over my shoulder, not sure if I should beware of falling pianos, rouge aliens or rabid wolverines!",5
"It's amazing how these reviews are turning into a creative word outlet for folks who need attention. Maybe they can use this app to increase their vocabulary and find new ways to entertain themselves. This app isn't terrible, so download for another take on a word game.",5
"I tried this and deleted it within an hour. I love word games, but this one simply is not worth $1.99. Maybe it would be worth half that... maybe.",2
It is a fun game to sit and relax with.  I love being able to choose the different categories.  I can avoid the ones I know little about.  Even the ones I am very familiar with give me a nice level of challenge.  I want to see even more categories for me to choose from.,5
"works well on HTC TB. I haven't played word games, or crossword puzzles in a long time. this has settings that are good for a beginner or child, or faster pace, for pros. I will use this as I realize how out of practice I am in word games. One is like a circle word game.",4
This game was quite boring. I played each type once and was ready to delete it after. Don't play if you're looking for a challenging word game.,2
"Played all the game modes and nothing really stood out. Worked fine, just seems a little boring. Annoyed I couldn't unselect a letter by touching it again.",3
I like apps that in some way challenge me when I don't have anything to do or I am just ... wasting time and waiting for some reason. THIS app does that. It really helps to pass the time and like playing scrabble. Thanks!,4
Thee really are so many word game apps out there and this one just isn't good. It gets boring fast.,2
"Love all kinds of word games.....so much so that they call me Webster at work! Love word scrambles and this is a lot like that, only you can play against a clock or at your own speed. Recommend to anyone that likes thinking and word games!",5
Haven't played it much yet but it seems like a fun word game. So far no buggy issues or force closes. If you like word games then today you just got a fun free game!,4
"I wasn't going to download this game at first simply because of low-starred reviews, people said it was boring, not challenging enough, etc. But I decided to try it and I must say I really love it!!! It's very fun, challenging enough for me (especially the untwist the word challenge, I love it!!) So thanks! I love to look at each day's FAOTD! This was a great one!",5
"Its a fun game. Works great on Kindle. I agree it does need to save your high score, but otherwise its a fun way to exercise your brain and your vocabulary. Definitely worth the free price.",4
"This app was fun, and took a new spin on a word search type of puzzle game, making it intriguing and a time-sucker. I loved this app and recommend it to anyone who likes to spell and likes words w/ friends or scrabble type of games. It's different than those, but a lot of fun and you will get hours of enjoyment out of it.",5
"This game is not much fun. In fact, it was so not fun, that to entertain myself I had to click ""see all my reviews"" and then use the drop down bar to select ""show most recent comments"" just to see the review I had initially written but had been deleted. Feel free to look it up.",5
It is somewhat like &#34;Words Plus&#34;.  I do like the three different ways this game can be played.  It's not easy to &#34;clear the board&#34;!,4
"wasn't a bad game, but it wasn't wonderful either. not something i'd play over and over, but also not something that i deleted right away.",3
"I absolutely love this game. the modes are fun as anything. I know I'm about to be nitpicking, but its not really filled with much content. imagine if u could play it with people around the world, or see high scores, all that stuff. still, u should defiantly get if u are a. spelling or vocabulary freak! like me!",4
Appstore is overflowing with mediocre word games like this. It needs another one like I need an eleventh toe. The game's fairly competent. Just bland &amp; ultimately surplus. Really bored with all these dull games on FAOTD.,2
I didn't really like this game much.  I tried it and deleted it right away.  It's just not my tastes.,3
This game is ok.  You play against yourself. Not so bad as far as word games go. I don't play that often.Prefer other word games.,4
this app is very fun but it is not worth the price if u bought it when it wasn't for the app of the day.  it has 3 fun games of words.  but I highly don't reccomend it if u r getting it when it is not free.,4
"The fact that it doesn't save the high scores kind of takes the challenge away. Gameplay seems smooth and it's 3 games in one, so if you get bored you can try a different game. If you're trying to beat your previous score though,  you need to remember what it is  !!!",3
this is good but it is bad at the same time overall it is good. papa Johns piazza . I like trains,5
Kept me awake and focused. Wonderful game to keep your mind off of negative thoughts as you sit in a hospital waiting room. I need something more than just shooting bubbles. You are led in stages to tougher patterns to solve and can get a hint if you get too stuck.,5
This is a great app.  I could play it for hours.  It stays challenging level after level.  My kids enjoy playing it also.,5
It's a fun way to kill time and it makes you think. Very awesome game and worth the download! :),4
iloved this game when I had my android. they have a bunch of othersnones ibwisj they would make avaliable for kindles,5
I some what like it. I play it ocassionaly. Not to interested in it but I do play it from time to time.,3
I wasn't sure if this game would be fun at first but now I love it so if you like puzzle games then you should definitely get this game today,5
"In this game you are given a grid of bubbles of various sizes which you must pop to clear the board. As each bubble is hit (with a satisfying POP!) it grows a size until finally it bursts, sending a blast to the nearest horizontal and vertical bubbles, which in turn causes them to grow. You are given a limited number hits, but as the bubbles burst they will do some of the popping for you.The trick is to figure out which bubbles to hit to cause a chain reaction of bubble popping splendor!A good time waster. You can solve bubble grid puzzles or play arcade mode to either get a high score or just to zone out on the pop pop popping.Minus one star simply because it can get dull doing nearly the same thing over and over, with no new challenges or rewards in higher levels.",4
I wasn't a fan! Thought it was going to be like Bubble Buster so I was very excited...sad to say I was just as disappointed.  I've removed the app.  :(,2
"My daughter got this for my 3 year old grand daughter who wanted to play a game on Nana's Kindle.  She is so smart and loved the game very much.  It was easy for her and she laughed and giggled and enjoyed it very much.  Who knew a three year old could manage a Kindle so well,,,,scary huh ?  lol",5
"I actually downloaded this app for my 4 year, thinking it was something different.  It's a little challenging for her, so she wasn't interested.  Let me tell you though, I've tried it and so far I really like it.  It's a game that takes some thought and I like that alot!",4
Very addicting!!!!!!  Who would think popping bubbles could still be so much fun.  Just one of my favorite games played daily.,4
Very addictive....challenging..I play this game when i get up in the morning and before bedtime.  Play it in Dr's waiting rooms...the time passes fast when playing this game,5
"Great time waster. I have lost countless hours playing this addictive game. I love it. I hope it never ends. However, I can't seem to get the updates on my Kindle Fire HE.",5
Good game to play....once you have passed the easy portion....can get tiresome though--if you play this for a while. Would recommend...,4
This is a great tool for me to fall asleep with at times of insomnia. Not that it is boring. It does take a certain amount of analytical skill to find the right paths to empty the bubbles. Wish more than a hint a day was available though....,4
Great game. Good fun trying to figure it out without getting the answers in a 24 hour slot. Great play to pass time.,5
this game is fun and it is hard as you get up the level. It is great but hard. OMG,5
I think they will have fun with it!We always fight over the kindle now they fight for this app and I fight for mine,5
I thought it was a ok little game if you like this kind of game then I think you would like it but for me the game was just too easy. I didn't play the game that much but the little I did was just too easy.,3
I just love to play this game. very additive.  the game works great on droids.  enjoy it more then the candy games.,5
"I ordered the game, played it once, and got bored.  I don't remember exactly why I didn't like it, but I deleted it from my collection.",1
"I don't think the game has much strategy because you don't know exactly what's going to happen, so you're kindof guessing where to put the bubble blaster at the start of the game. I like when games have more strategy, rather than just randomly placing the blaster and then seeing what happens. But the popping noise is really cool!",3
I have a great time playing this game. I would recommend it to anyone. I'm so glad I tried it.,5
"I have had this one on my android phone for a year or so, and now it is much better with the tablet.",5
This an interesting app and it does everything it said it would. I find it useful in writing reviews. Type in a word and you will have a number of words to use.,5
This app helps me say what I wanna say but don't always have the recall or lack of knowledge to say the right word.,5
This app is so extremely limited in its options that one could come up with more synonyms from memory. I uninstalled this almost immediately after opening it and finding the &#34;cupboards bare!&#34;,1
"I really can't give a competent review because I haven't used it more than once or twice.  I usually use the paperbound Thesaurus, and sometimes one online via my desktop.",3
this was much needed to prevent meter abruptions while writting. I am very happy to have purchased this book from Amazon kindel dept.,5
This is a great app to have at your finger tips. You can quickly find anything you want or need in a hurry. Love it!,5
"It servers it's purpose. I like to write, but have a limited vocabulary. Public Schools will do that to a person. Hahahaha but really..it's great for students of all ages.",3
"ThisThesaurusapp for the Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD is a good one. Despite it's white-on-white upper case 'T' icon that's difficult to see here, it's a worthy consideration when you need to take a word search a bit deeper.Granted that the Kindle Fire devices have a decent way to check the spelling for the words that you may enter, in its native form you have no way of looking for that similar, alternative word that might fit your needs a bit better. As a reference work for basic needs in grouping words together according to similarity of meaning, and containing synonyms and often antonyms, this is an app that works well.At less than 180KB, it's a fast download, and once installed, you'll find its interface easy to use and quite intuitive. It also keeps a history of the words that you've looked up.TheThesaurusapp for the original Kindle Fire or the Kindle Fire HD series is recommended for wordsmiths of all ages, and the price is quite reasonable for all it does.10/16/2012; Updated 1/5/2013",5
Everyone needs a thesaurus they can get at.  You know what it is and I sometimes use it for writing stories.  I get senior moments now and then and often find the perfect word with this little gem.,5
"As long as crosswords are a challenge, I will find this source of info helpful.  Knowing other associated words helps proper use.",3
"Yep-another one that I found useless because we don't have wifi anywhere close to us in the national forest. Downloaded it at the library, got home and couldn't use it. Not worth the time or money, if you have to pay for it.",1
This is one item everyone should have. There are times you need a different word to explain or express what you are saying in more detail. This is it. I love it. Even if you only use it several times a year. you'll be glad you had it.Highly recommend to all. Plus the price was right!!Get it and you won't be disappointed.,5
easy to use and what I was looking for. This is a keeper and recommend thisyou need to not require word counts...,5
"Only records on my side of the msg, you do not hear the other person and not very easy to use.",1
"I love this application, it's the first call recorder app that actually records both sides of the call clearly while in the middle of the (instead of before call is answered) and records perfectly WITHOUT the call being on speaker (every other call recording app requires this)! Don't bother with another recording app this one has the easiest use & works flawlessly!",5
"I've been trying to find out how to get in touch with the developer since I downloaded this app. It will record and save the conversation, but it WILL NOT PLAY BACK! I have even forwarded to myself in an email only to have an empty file arrive. I have done everything as instructed and verified that indeed there is a recording there that lists an amount of time, e.g. 3 minutes, 32 seconds, but it won't even start to play! How in the world do I get it to play back??",1
"This app is amazing and does exactly what it says it will do. I was worried after reading some of the other reviews, but I downloaded it anyway and I'm extremely impressed. I had an important phone interview for a homework assignment and I wanted to make sure that I wouldn't forget anything that was said. This app recorded the entire 20 minute conversation and auto-emailed me a copy of the audio recording. I highly recommend changing the audio format in settings to MPEG-4 and choosing the auto upload to your Gmail account. I will definitely pay for the full version once the trial time expires. 5 stars all the way!",5
"Don't even bother if you are looking for a free app, this is a trial version. False advertising totally and completely",1
"This is simple, easy, and good to play when you don't have a deck of cards around, or you have a deck or cards but no place to play.",5
"it realy is not worth it, just suck it up and buy a better version.  i love spider solitare but don't really mess with this one",2
"it didn't download.  spider is my favorite solitaire game,  sorry i missed it. i am looking for other free games.",3
I found that it would lock up and that there were no clear backup key or directions to be found.,2
Love this one and performs very well.  Plays it very often and it is stimulating and fun to play this game.,5
I couldn't figure out how to play this game. I maybe could have called May day. I'm sure they could have helped.,1
"I always play this game with 2 suites and since I set the game to play only solvable puzzles, I won't give up on a game until I've solved it.  It is hard enough to exercise your brain, but not so difficult that you have spend hours on each game.  (My best time is 4 minutes and my average time is 11 minutes, so this is a game that you can play while waiting a few minutes for a dr. appt, or while a passenger in a car.)  If you don't exit out of the game, your game in progress will still be there the next time you open it.  I just press the button that brings me back to my phone's home page if I need to stop the game and do something else and then the game is waiting for me the next time I open the game.  I also have the free solitaire and free cell games from Odesys.  I like them too and they also have a setting for playing only solvable games.",5
"Has been a great challenge and continue to entertain. Not just a game of chance, it requires a level of skill.",5
Love the game and always looking for them. I have it on my Kindle Fire and play it a lot.,5
If you are a one of those people who enjoy a great game of solitaire this is the game for you. It makes you think out a plan of attack and stick as close to it as possible to win the game. The interface is kind of out of date.  That is the only reason I didn't give it five stars. Thanks Odesys for a grate game.,4
you win about 1 out of 100..if that's your idea of fun get this game...sometimes with one the three versions you can't possibly win the moment the cards are dealt,1
Great app...now all I need is a hammer and nail app.;)...... ..... .... .... .... .... ..... ...... . . .ml,4
"While it seems perfectly functional as a level, I have yet to find an opportunity to use it, so I can't comment on its usefulness during a project.  However, depending on the job, I might not want to stick my kindle into the middle of construction...",4
Gave Kindles to my kids for Christmas.  They love to download free Amazon apps for their entertainment!  They enjoyed this app.  My favorite part... It's FREE and actually works!!!  Thanks Amazon!,5
this app is a great one for use on my kindle. It allows me to check the level of items without rummaging through a tool bag. great app.,5
Plain simple &amp; ACCURATE bubble level! Perfect! No unwanted junk/crap. Just a  tool...me likey! THANK YOU for making a simple streamlined app that works just like it supposed to!,5
This app works exactly like a professional level and it's very accurate too! It has an optional grid for more precision.,4
This is super handy and works fairly well. I used it when hanging pictures and building a shelf. I did notice that when I was showing it to my brother in a car that he tried to tell me it didn't work. Turns out the curve we were going through affected the sence of direction in it which I found interesting.,5
"It works as well as it can on my device. it can be calibrated and it can display gridlines.  it will display the angle a well as the 'bubble' and can also display other units such a in/ft.  it displays full screen on my tablet.  my tablet is a viewsonic gtablet and has aknown issue where the accelerometer axes are not set up as they are in other devices so i can't set up calibration on two sides at once, but I cannot fault the app for that; I need to flash a custom rom. :)",5
"I had downloaded this app on my Kindle Fire just to check it out and thought it was fairly decent.  It was about 2 weeks later when I was putting up a shelf and my actual level was not in the tool box or anywhere else I looked. Then I remembered I had this app and grabbed my Kindle, stood it on its side on top of the shelf, made the needed adjustment and secured it to the wall. Later that day when I finally came across my level, I double checked to see how accurate it turned out and it couldn't have been any more level than it was. I am impressed and although it may only come in handy once in a great while, it still is a very useful app.",5
Only wish it was optimized for my tablet. Still very nice level. They should add an option for a bullseye level.,5
...and it's free.  What more could be said than that other than it's a wonderful application of this aneroid device's capabilities.,5
"On my Xoom, it is in profile mode only, thinking it is in landscape mode so all levels are on wrong axis. Other 'scales' like slope% or mm per m, would be nice but it is free.",3
"A very versatile tool! Amazing what a great idea! Thanks! Very handy anytime, I have given the 3D level 'a good going over' I can assure that it is very accurate, a very ingenious way to eliminate those long obnoxious levels.  (legal way to  have your cell phone on the job) tool!  Who would have thought to put a real time level in a cell phone? (in my case the construction company that I work for carries insurance on my cell phone because it is a work tool).Tea Kies CooperProvo, Utah",5
Amazing what the Kindle Fire does.  This nifty little app works.  There's not a whole lot to say about it but wow it works.,5
What guy doesn't need a level in his phone?  This one is graphically different than most and appears to work well.,4
"This thing is fascinating to watch, and easy to use. It has a sphere (graphic) filled with fluid, as well as two cylinders - each filled with fluid and a bubble. You can choose grid mode (handy to see just how close or far-off you are) or not.  I will be using this for small jobs from now on. The regular-sized &quot;real&quot; ones are too ungainly for small jobs. This is definitely an app I'm glad I downloaded.",5
Works perfectly fine on my kindle fire 2nd gen.Never know when you will need a level.Don't know yet about the internet connection thing.,5
"I don't think that this app is worth $2.99, it's really low resolution on my screen and I didn't see any themes online that wowed me either.Not too shabby, but it could use some work, everything looked pixelated and artifacts were everywhere.I'll stick with LauncherPro.",2
"Maybe but I'm not convinced. I happen to like Honeycomb's standard interface more than dxTop's but that's a matter of taste. Objectively, the scope of this app - take near-complete control of my desktop (and yes, it comes with custom icons and themes) - was enough of a concern for me to remove it shortly after installation. I asked myself how other, more modest add-ons would perform while dxTop was in charge and I find the answer quickly. ""Application Folder Pro"", my favorite folder organizer was unusable under the new management. Others apps and widgets may be preempted but that's as far as my investigation went.If accepted as the alternative interface, the app is deep and complex enough to demand quite a substantial time investment but that would be okay if the rewards justified the effort. In my case (XOOM, Honeycomb) they don't. I wasn't able to justify allowing a ""vendor's"" app to make phone calls on my behalf without me knowing it, just to mention one of the more intrusive rights you grant the app as you install it. And, on a more parochial note, dxTop was stuck in 'portrait' on my XOOM. There may be some setup option that might change that to 'auto-rotate' but I removed dxTop before I found it.For 'positives', this does appear to be a well-thought, well-designed overlay but it's a radical departure from Android's way of interacting with the end-user so one of the first questions that popped into my mind was: if they believe that Android's interface deserves to be so completely wiped out, why not produce their own mobile OS? Seriously.In the Android world what I need and in fact I welcome at this time is 'helpers' such as 'App Folder Pro', not a new boss. dxTop tries to make itself the boss and I have not use for that.",2
"I have to say that I enjoyed interacting with my phone in a new way.  The diamond pattern option of flipping around app screens is cool.  Overall the theme has a great look and feel.  I also liked being able to look up apps alphabetically, or by usage.  I don't know if I will prefer it to the original theme in the long run, but it is always fun to try something new.",5
"this app is old school and it works just like I remember it. Normally, I prefer this as an alternative desktop but currently I'm attached to the Cyanogen modded theme on my Nexus.",5
"I have had this app for about a year and have loved it until recently. It keeps telling me there is and update but then when I try to update it tells me it is unable to update and try later. The 2 times I did it to update it then does the package installer thing. Once that completes, it says Install Failed! I have not found a way to contact the developer to get help and if this is not fixed SOON I will be finding something else!",3
Not as good as other launchers. It has potential but is definitely not in the same league as the others. HTC sense is better by far.,2
"Does exactly what it says, changes your home screen organization and allows you to customize it.  Works well on tmobile g2 p",5
"First, it gives me no problems. Works well, does what it should etc.But, it offers no options or customization that aren't in a few free Home alternative (not listed here for etiquette, but you can find them by searching the market).If you don't have access to the standard Android Market, I can see this being a viable option for you; otherwise, just go with a free one. :-\",3
Nice diamond concept but I like the original home screens for the DROID x. This is not as intuitive for me.,2
only a call to Motorola got me back running....fix this!!!  It's truly an awful app that renders a Xoom useless...,1
I liked the idea and used it on my Optimus T for a while but it ran like a dog! A family member installed this (accidentally...they like pretty buttons) on my Ideos S7 Slim and now it's bricked.So...will brick your device or make it run remarkably s-l-o-w. Not a positive experience.,1
"So, I read the description and I'm psyched, right? Just what I'm looking for! Well, not quite.I always go through the reviews before installing. But I always download because I want to be ready to pounce. Even despite the reviews I was like, &quot;Huh, maybe it will still work.&quot;  My dissapointment set in when I went to install it and the permissions were far more reaching than the capabilities of not only the descriptions but the reviews.This app wants to read my messages? It wants to read my system log? Why? It wants unintrusive access to everything on my phone which, if it's replacing the Droid OS, I understand BUT when I look at the reviews and the full capabilities of the app it makes me extremely nervous. It's just this side of jailbreaking my phone as it is, no reason to invite trouble where it isn't needed.",2
"Yesterday (or the day before) the free app of the day was something to organize apps into folders, with added functionality.  That app was rated well, as there is, arguably, a use for it and the app was intuitive and ran well.  This app replaces something that doesn't need replacing.  Whether you run Froyo or Gingerbread, either will be faster and smoother than this offering.  I can see limited appeal for those who feel the need to customize and tweak and recustomize their devices, but I have better things to do with my time than &quot;fix&quot; what isn't broken and replace it with something that isn't quite as good.",2
"I love playing with launchers but this one is mystifying. It is difficult to use and navigate. It tries and fails to import your home screens that you already have so you don't have to do much customisation.  It crashes Home Switcher. It does support scrolling widgets, but that is not nearly redeeming enough. Launcherpro or ADW are far better free alternatives.",2
I know a lot of work went into this app. It's not a bad app. It just doesn't offer me any feature that would lure me away from the default.,3
I hope the free app every day continues. How anyone could degrade a gift is strange to me. I seldom comment but I was tired of all the negative comments. This launcher rates up there with the best of them. BELIEVE. THAT!!,5
"Good features and it solved my delayed icon displaying issue. I have a rooted Droid, stock rom. This home app has 5 home pages. 3 Customized bottom row shortcut bars. Compatible wit beautiful Widgets. Plus advanced feature like a button to show running and recent programs and services. Advanced users will likely enjoy it.",5
"I've been playing around with this launcher for the last 5 hours, at first it was really cool, even though ALL my widgets disappeared. They have alot of nice options to customize  I was even able to get a weather widget to open but finally I got fed up needing to search for everything I normally have right on the front screen. Not bad but inconvenient, next best thing to rooting your phone I guess though.",3
I like this app. Don't have to spend a lot of time on it.  Works great on my Droid 2.,4
I have tried many home alternative apps &amp; have found very few of them to be as useful &amp; easy to use as the dxTop is. I have been using the free version for a few months &amp; have loved it but took the opportunity to upgrade to the pro version since it was the Amazon free app of the day. I am thrilled with this app &amp; plan to continue using it. I highly recommend this app to everyone. Enjoy :),5
"There are some interesting features and the themes are great but it's lacking things I've grown accustomed to having with ADW...like smooth transitions, resizable widgets, FULL customizability and a fairly small memory footprint.I'm not saying it isn't a decent launcher. I'm just saying that I expect more from a paid app than what can be gotten from a free app.",3
"If your going to spend the money to buy this just go to Android market and but ADW launcher EX.As a launcher this does what it says, the setting screen is a little gaudy but simple. The collapsable mini menus suck.  It might also had just been me but it didn't look very high quality.",3
"Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6Oh, another launcher replacement!  Love these, and customizing was the whole reason for leaving the iPhone behind.  I've tried out lots of them, ADW, Launcher Pro, VTL, and more, settling in on Go Launcher EX for my phone and tablet. Along comes dxTop Pro, and I'm ready to give it a go.Comparing against my previous experience, dxTop Pro isn't too shabby.  It has lots of customization built in, including an iPhone-like lock screen replacement.  There are a fair number of themes for it, but many will cost you and there aren't nearly as many as there are for other launchers.  On both devices, the performance felt laggy, not as snappy as what I'm used to.  Flipping between screens rapidly, say from all the way left to all the way right, invariably stalled and required a second swipe to get to the last screen.  Looking that the resources being used, dxTop Pro eats up a good bit more than Go Launcher EX (22-30MB vs 17-21MB). The included screen capture is a nice idea, but had a tendency to stick and shoot multiple shots.  The captured images didn't include the wallpaper, which is a bummer.  Sadly, the screen capture only worked outside of applications.  The folder setup is depreciated from stock, in that you have to manually put items into the folders one at a time.  On the plus side, you can change the folder icon to whatever you like, including photos.To sum it all up, dxTop has a bunch of cool little features but they come at a price.  Perhaps as it matures it will get better. I'll hang onto it for a bit but have a feeling I'll be back to Go Launcher EX within a week or two.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/questions",3
"nothing great. I've been trying to get a feel of it and its failing so far. I will probably uninstall since its too difficult to get use to. I read the reviews first and still like to try it my self, however I got to agree with what most are saying about it. Nothing special and its ugly. I tried to like it.",2
"I always appreciate when people think outside the box and try to give a new perspective on things.  With this app though, I think more personal preference was put into the design and layout, rather than thought about what others would enjoy or find useful.Then again it could just be me.  I couldn't get used to the home screen diamond navigation or the quick access buttons.  I found them all rather clunky and hard to use.  The list of apps organized into running, services, recent waas nice.Overall the whole interface ran slower that the default one, and made the choice to uninstall a no brainer.  Better luck next time.",2
It's not really a bad app for free but it makes my fascinate run VERY very slow...will probably end up uninstalling,2
"dxtop is pretty interesting. im not a huge fan of the cube homescreens.. it works really awkwardly sometimes. i also only use 2 homescreens on stock, as any more is just unnecessary for me.but the dock is awesome. i love the idea of it. it actually works really good in my opinion. in the dock i just have the apps that i most frequently use and the news widgets (and a couple more app shortcuts)  on the screen and im set. id only need one homescreen. and the app drawer being alphabetized and skipping to letters is very conveniant.i dont really have any lag problems when i use default dxtop theme. but i downloaded a couple to try out and thats when i had lag set in. so i just stick with the default, which isnt too bad imo anyway.this is a cool home alternative to try with some great ideas and things going for it. further deveopment could definately sway me away from stock. fun to use for a couple days right now though, especially considering its FAOTD.",4
"I have a Motorola ATRIX and just got the 2.3.4 Gingerbread update. IMHO this update makes this program unnecessary. I spent hours working to get the dxTop close to what I already had with the Android OS and the dxTop was still inferior. To make matters worse is that a few hours later, the dxTop lost my settings, so I would have had to do it all over again. I uninstalled it and am quite happy to be using the Android homepage once again. I am glad that I got it free or I would have been upset. Perhaps a more seasoned pro could make it work, but for me, no thanks.",1
"As soon as I saw the iPhone &quot;slide to unlock&quot; on my home screen, I uninstalled this right away. I don't have an iPhone, I don't have an iPhone, I have found a better way and I don't want me phone to look like an iPhone. I know its somewhat customizable and maybe I'll play with it more later, but not a good first impression.",2
kinda laggy on my thunderbolt running cm7.  the clock widget is kind of fuzzy looking like a low resolution photo too.  will probably go back to launcher pro.,3
Clock widget could use a resolution update. HTC sense is like 1000 times better overall. This launcher could be good after some more development.,3
"No issues. Smooth, functional, customizable. Easy learning curve for operation. Fun and different. I have many apps I use daily; ability to folder huge plus.",3
Pandahome is better. It has more options to customize and it uses almost half of the memory this one does.,2
"dxTop pro installed and ran on my dx2 flawlessly, but ran slowly, so slowly that I uninstalled it within in an hour. Home screens load slowly, and when you open the applications folder, the apps slowly appear in random order. I did like some of the gui features, but can't stand the lag. -3 stars for poor performance.",2
"There are better launchers like Open Home 6. I've been running Open Home 6 for a good while now and it's my favorite of all of the other major launchers like Launcher Pro, ADW Launcher, and Go Launcher..",2
"I am giving this three stars because I didn't really give it a chance. my qualms with this app were two things: the fact it auto starts, and also that it was a big pain to uninstall on my droid x2. I downloaded it and installed and there was no choice in turning it on or off, it just starts up. then not liking that fact I tried to uninstall it and it wasn't in my app list. might be a great app but I just didn't like the design or functionality of it.",3
"It's not smooth enough, make it so we won't have to swipe the whole screen. and when we open the app drawer and hold to place a shortcut, add a drag-to-uninstall option at the top or bottom. kudos on the up and down swipe",3
"It really didn't look good at all and just looked really bad. I use HTC Sense on EVO 3D and it really blows it away... i have used other home replacements and there are some really good ones for free, but this one for paid needs to really reconsider why someone would pay for this, I mean what are you getting it is pretty bad looking...",1
"I use LauncherPro as my home screen and have grown quite attached to it. But I thought I'd give this one a fair go to see if it was worth considering. If you are tired of your stock home screen then, yes, I think you should give this a look. It seems zippy and allows you a little more customization than some stock home screens allow. The biggest thing that irked me as that it replaced how I turn on my phone (the launch screen, is it called?). It completely replaced it and didn't ask me if it was okay first. Worst yet, I dug around the options and could not figure out how to turn my old screen back on. It was about this time that I gave up on it. Otherwise, I mostly liked what I saw and liked that it offered a lot of options (just not the one I wanted).Worth considering, especially today while it is free, but it wasn't up to LauncherPro status to me.",3
other home replacements were laggy or changed since the much that it was a pain to use my phone?? this one changes just enough without leaving you lost.. great navigation.. really really like it... Samsung galaxy 4 G,5
"I hate not leaving a good review but if this application is better than the stock launcher on your phone than I feel sorry for your phone. It's messed up to navigate through all the screens especially if you have scrolling widgets,  plus it has a generic look to it. I well be sticking to my adwEX Launcher. Glade I got this for free or man would I be really disappointed.",2
"I feel this launcher is kind of the Winamp among media players. By default it isn't the most beautiful, but you can customize it to death.What I do like:- apps sorted alphabetically in a clear fashion- lots of themes- 5 way switching between homescreens,  would work nice with 5 screensWhat I don't care about:- the recent apps drawer with services and running apps- 5 homescreen. I don't need so many. So it kind of makes the 5 way switching useless- a gazillion themes.  It should look great by defaultWhat I dislike:- it's a lot more sluggish than go launcher ex or the default touching on my phone- themes are pricey. I don't want to pay more for a theme than for the app.- it looks low-def on my screen. And the ui has many inconsistent quality things.- lack of included widgets,  go launcher has great widgets",3
"it ran slower than stock on droid 2,  loaded the menu slower,  and not to crazy about the look.  seemed plain looking to me.  running droid 2 on 2.2, and its not rooted.",2
"This launcher has locked up my Droid X something serious. Even when switching back to ADW, there are huge unmanageable delays in everything I try to do. There is no reason a non 3d launcher should be locking up a Droid X this badly, even if it is an outdated device now. I'd avoid this one folks. Uninstalling immediately, this is unbearable.",1
"Ugh. I had always just had the default interface and felt it was fine, but my brother does a lot of customizing with his myTouch 4G, so I thought, &quot;Eh, why not try it out?&quot; Never again will I try to change the home layout. This app is so clunky! I hated every interaction I had with it, and I can't believe anybody would pay $3 for this piece of crap.Do yourself a favor and leave this one alone. Terrible, terrible, terrible.",1
"Maybe it's a step up if you have an older phone, but it's a step way down from my Evo. Sense never stops running, but it's overlayed with this. If you Force Close it under settings/applications, it goes away and you're back to normal. I uninstalled it. It's a good attempt at being cool, but its reinventing the wheel without actually replacing the wheel.",1
"I have an HTC phone, so I already have all these features with Sense. Not an attractive interface. Functions smoothly.",2
"I don't understand why all the negative reviews. This is a very good home replacement app. I've used every alternative out there and while this is definitely not the best it's nowhere near the worst. Just because it's different and you don't know how to use it doesn't mean it's a bad app.  There's no way I'd pay anything for this app, not with GO being free and a much better option, but for free dxTop certainly deserves a download. My advice, ignore the bad reviews and try it yourself. It's free for f's sake!And to the reviewer below me, no, this app did not break your phone. If you believe that is even possible you need to immediately post your EVO on craigslist and go buy an iPhone.",4
launcher pro and others are far superior as launchers but its not a terrible home replacement app.  used in two years ago and it hasn't improved much.,3
"Got this for free, just gave it a few days to try out the features before reviewing. The description touts the diamond pattern layout of the windows, and that is the greatest thing this app brings to the table, which I have not seen in any other launcher so far. Makes you wonder why no one else came up with the idea to lay out your screens to minimize swipe after swipe to get to what you're looking for.Unfortunately, that's also the only great thing I see here. The app drawer appears forgotten, lacking the ability to drag and sort, or create folders to group apps in. (GoLauncher does this for free, btw) The interface has a little sluggishness to it, which never helps. It runs okay on my Thunderbolt (rooted and running DasBAMF 1.8.6 Remix), and looks kindof like crap on my Galaxy Tab 10.1 (stock), (but so far, everything else does too, so no love lost here).Then there is the killer, which took this from a four star app to three, and I even considered two because this was the reason I uninstalled: when my phone reboots I get a message several times telling me that Amazon AppStore is no longer installed. I assume this nuisance alert appears because some Amazon service is still starting up, but why should my app launcher care what market/store I have installed? Must have something to do with licensing, but I think this is as unnecessary as it is annoying. Just open my apps and display my widgets, and don't tell me what needs to be installed, outside of what installed with your launcher.",3
I have nothing against it. It's only a launcher. I just prefer to use ADW.. It is fairly stable on my phone. But I just don't like the way it works.,1
I did not like it as a replacement for my home theme. But it may be useful to others. I deduct a star because it was confusing to use and I did not find it useful for the way I use my phone.,4
"This could be pretty cool I guess. I personally care for the look of the Gingerbread setup better, but this app has potential. Now though, it's clunky and limited. I'm not a fan. Maybe after an update it'll improve.",3
"The interface was nice, but my widgets were gone and so were my file organizer links. (I think that was a free app a while ago) A great idea but it need some touching up.",3
so far so good!  no problems at all with it and i like the customize options!  All kinds of extras- a lot are freedroid pro 610,5
app seems to do what it is supposed to.  hasn't slowed down or caused any problems with MyTouch 4G. will down load a theme to see how that works before rating app higher than 3 stars.Update: downloaded a theme. everything still working good so I've upped the star rating.,4
"The Launcher is nothing spectacular,It doesn't let you use your own widgets. it removed all of the ones I was using and it could not re add the two widgets that I want to use which was Blizzards Real ID and Fancy Widget pro.The screen is slow to respond on my inspire, and I didn't like that the home screen was now CLEAR to the right and not in the center of their cross setup. Also I gave this link to a friend of mine with an atrix, which has duel cores and a bigger active memory base, he says it also slows down his entire device. so clearly they need to do some heavy optimization.The Lock screen mimic's the iPhone lock screen, which again is very slow to response and feels clunky and slow to respondThe one touch application menu in the center is a pretty slick idea.The addition of instant access to your Text messaging program is pretty cool, but it' not really setup for customizationIt has potential but it has a hell of a long way to go to get there.I'm giving this two stars because it has possibilities and some rather interesting ideas, nothing terrible innovative or remarkable. It just needs work.",2
you can get free themes from the market. but there's no way to change the iPhone style lock screen. also every time you open your app list it takes a few seconds to load. that slow down is just annoying. maybe good for some people but my Thunderbolt has enough stock customization. uninstalled.,3
just not for me. launcher pre and adw are much better. I like the dock and other features in those better. maybe great for some.,2
"I am using this on my rooted Captivate. It works extremely well. Very smooth and the widgets and look screen are a nice touch.Overall very impressed.I have tried many home replacements including but not limited too ADW ex, Launcher Pro, Go Launcher, Pandahome, Launcher 7, Mr. Home, Regina, aHome, etc ... Well... you should get the picture. All of the have some things that make them unique and none of them are perfect. dxTop pro isn't over the top with settings and customizations but it is unique and works very well.ADW ex is my favorite and go to launcher but dxTop Pro will definitely get it's use.Side note: Wake up Amazon! Allowing all of these stupid review is ruining your market. I can't imagine too many more developers are going to want to take a chance on faulty review scores because the stupid person downloading a FREE app didn't get the game they thought they deserved. Just another way we see how entitlements are ruining are society!",5
"I was expecting a much better interface. Compared to many of the other launchers out there, this one seems old and tired.",2
I tried it for a little while. Wasn't too impressed. I'm just going to stick with the stock HTC Sense 3.0. This app had a few features I liked but just wasn't enough to change my mind.,3
I gave the dev 3 stars to be fair because this isn't a detailed review. I really just wanted to say that I can't stand when devs design apps that make you feel like you're using a knock-off iPhone. I use Android by choice! EVO 3D,3
"At first this thing was pretty cool, but then it started to slow down my phone as I added widgets onto it. I also like to point out that you can resize your calender or any other widgets on the wall. The way it organized my app is pretty cool but all the negatives things kind of made me want to uninstall the app.",2
"While it is functional for the most part, its ugly and cant compete wither gingerbread os on stock Droid 3",3
"I tried this despite some poor reviews, but deleted it right away. I didn't like anything it did to my phone. It didn't slow like some said. No thank you. Droid X.",2
I didn't have much expectation from this launcher and was pleasantly surprised. I like the layout and the varied custimization. Take time to see what it offers and how tidy yet gorgeous it makes your home pages and app drawers. I'm hooked and that isn't an easy task ;0  Ty Amazon for offering it as FAOD &amp; Devs!,5
Wonderful home replacement for devices running 2.2 and below. Speeds up response time on my Captivate but slows it down with my Nexus S. If your like me and repurposed your older devices than this home replacement may become one of your new best friends.,4
"This is better than most reviews.  the app works fine, and there are lots of themes for this on the market.  I did however delete it off my phone since I liked the stock one just as much.  This app does a good job of adding choices to the android community.  The first minute of use seemed lagy, but then it took off fine.",5
"This app isn't bad at all. The sliding dock and dual app drawers are a nice touch. I've looked around the market and online at current themes and icon packs but in the end I'll stick with the stock HTC Sense. Maybe once I find an icon pack that replaces everything I have on my home screens, I might try this again.",4
This launcher just seemed old in a lot of its looks. It didn't seem to be as customizable as some if the newer (and free) launcher. This was very laggy. Slightly below average in my opinion.,2
"I really like the idea of this app and I wish the Dev the best of luck with it, but in terms of performance, I just can't use it. This replacement UI really slowed down my Droid X.After uninstalling my phone also did a random reboot. Reminded me of a dog getting out of water and shaking to get the remnants off.",3
"nice app, glad i got it while it was freex, but i still would have paid for it.if you want better reviews then go to the android market, most of the reviews give this app 5 stars, so i do not understand the negative reviews, those stupid people probably have a really crappy phone that cannot run anything and they are just whiny babies. i tell you the day the faotd has no 1 star reviews, is they day i win the lotto......come on amazon, change the age to be able to review.",5
"removing this application from my phone was my favorite part about it. it runs slowly, isn't intuitive and isn't better than anything you're already used to.I got this app for free, yet I feel cheated.",1
"at first I want impressed, but after giving it a few minutes and trying a few themes it is actually growing on me.  i have tried numerous launchers and this one may give my adwlauncher a break.  it seemed to ruin slow at first then impressed after a couple minutes so give it a minute before you judge.",4
I like this app on my Galaxy Tab. I have played around with it and found that I like the customizations. I can get to my widgets and every other app easily. I may download and try one of the themes but they are $1.99 each  andi have not found the&quot;perfect&quot; one yet.I worried that I would lose my application folders but they are all there and working..  I gave this app 4 stars because it delivers what it says it does.,4
Couldn't get this app to work,1
"This is an excellent application that delivers what it promises...as long as dedicated amateurs have one their terrestrial radios tuned to provide the data sources that make this worthwhile.While some people might consider listening to emergency services radios voyeuristic or creepy: as somebody who spends far more time each day in a car trying to get to and from work than I'd like, this app offers --at least where I live-- true value added.My daily commute is sandwiched between two major metropolitan areas, in an area that gets overlooked during drive-time traffic reporting. The police/fire feed for the county where 90% of my daily commuting takes place provides me valuable warning on road problems that traffic reporters would be telling me about far too late...if at all.Easy to use; search by name, genre or location, or search for any audio within a radius near you. No stability issues running on an anHTC Evo 4gVery few differences between this and thepaidversion. Paid version drops ads, and adds a pause/play button that is persistent between sessions (and you can run the free and paid version at the same time to follow two programming sources).",4
Great app designed by someone that is willing to share his abilities. App has many options to chose from and has not had any bugs as of yet. Unlike other apps this one doesn't ask for money. Keep up the good work Gorden!,5
The Scanner is OK Because it Works fine and Shows me instructions.the Scanner has everything everyone needs to help you not to be arrested.,3
"This allows you to stream signals provided by volunteers which capture and stream the actual radio signals with traditional radio hardware.  Your desired location or department may or may not be available - but if it is, this app sure is handy!",5
"I keep downloading this app and then deleting it. Its not something I use that often or would see myself using on a regular basis. I basically re-download it when I see a lot of firetrucks or police in my area and want to hear whats going on. Otherwise, it eats up a lot of battery when trying to hear something that might not be going on.",3
"Most of the time you get close to nothing for 'nothing' but this free little app actually does what you would expect it to do. It gets you police radio conversation (even comes with a 10-codes translator file). It lets you:- set alerts based no the number of people listening to a specific scanner- mark your own favorites- finds stations 'near you' based on your location- has a top-50 list based on the number of listeners- lets you browse by area (in 15 countries), genre and source- shows 'new additions'- at least on a tablet's large screen the ads are small and unobtrusiveOn my XOOM (Android 3.2) I am able to continue to listen to the police talk while running other tasks such as browsing the Web or writing emails.Good work. Recommended.",5
If you're like me and like listening to your scanner you will love this app. I put it on my Kindle Fire and it works as advertised and I'm able to listen to both the Las Vegas PD as well as Nevada Highway Patrol with no problems. Only caveat is that all areas are not yet covered so if there's not an audio feed for your area this would be wasted to you.,5
"Great app to listen to. Never realized how busy chicago police are till I listened to a little while of their feed. One complaint I read about on the google market is that there are limited feeds outside major cities and very few outside the united states, since many scanners are encrypted. Very well made app and volunteers run the feeds.",5
"I have been listening to scanners since they had crystals in them! Now they are trunked and newer scanners are expensive. Then I got a HTC Hero and this app and got the Scanner pro for free when they offered it. You can use it anywhere, anytime. I love both of them, free and pro and you can run them at the same time. If it is busy, it can by messy listening tho, :)But I love everything it does and hope it will do more. I would love to volunteer. Would love WSP too. A must have app for scanner lovers! Never had any problems with the actual app either, lots of work went into it.",5
"Has numerous stations, weather, police, fire, rescue, ham radio, too many to mention. Use it all the time, highly recommend. Never had a problem with this app.",5
because where I'm located a lot of times nothing comes through. I can only get out of the area not local.,3
I work for a small PD and even we're on here - can get everything I need and it's easy to use.,5
listen in as cops patrol your area. very addictive! sit at home and ride along as your friends get pulled over!,4
"Much improved for my location in Maryland. I can now listen to Baltimore County, Baltimore City, and My nephew in Pa.",5
"the volume for my cricket zte was very low, but that is the only problem i have found so far",4
The signal is more reliable when I listen to police calls within major counties around the country. I like that it covers the major police stations/channels within several hundred miles.,3
"I cannot recall exactly why I deleted it, but it worked and I found the interface to be easily manageable, but it didn't have my local police or fire (but that wasn't why I deleted it, interesting).",4
This has worked very well for me.  I live in a rural area outside of the city I work in and I work with law enforcement agencies.  I like to be able to hear the folks I work with on the job and know that they are doing everything they can to make our lives safer and enjoyable.,5
"Some call it nosey, I call it wanting to know why sirens are blaring. For free, this app works well and has a wide array of precincts to select. I live in Eastern PA and can select from multiple counties.",5
i was able to listen to local an out of state radio and police scanners. it was fun. i would recommend this app to anyone.,3
I love this app. Its nice to be able to listen to the scanner to where I am from in Tennessee and the local scanner in my town.,5
"There's nothing quite like listening in on all the foolishness happening around you, or knowing if something is going on in your neighborhood. It's sort of like getting the local news before the news stations give it to you. Everyone I know is laughing at me for having this app, but I will be the one taking side roads while they're stuck in traffic because the police shut down a section of the freeway. Take that.",5
This app just gets better with every update.  It is exactly what I wanted...works flawlessly every time.  I use it on my kindle fire and my Samsung Galaxy ii ...super!,5
"I don't hate it, but can't say I'm completely thrilled with it. It's not always available for listening, Apparently its controlled by &#34;volunteers&#34; or something like that....eh...but it was free, so can't really complain too much I guess.",3
For a free app this works great. Even provides basic 10 codes.Works great on the kindle fire. Would love to see future updatesinclude notes & a record feature.,5
"Very interesting app. Keep up the good work guys. Just wish Stoddard County was on here, you know. :) Good job.",5
"This is much cheaper than a Radio Scanner you purchase.  I get out local sheriff, police, ambulance, etc.  Great scanner.",5
"Everyone loves to know what is going on around them and with this scanner radio in your area, you can be sure to stay on top of important local happenings. The app is great, easy to use and the settings make the experience more pleasing.",5
"I love this app and for being free, you can't beat it.  I listen to my hometown police and ems services while living 500 miles away.  Definite 5 stars.",5
The radio works well and picks up the local emergency services channels in our area. I would recommend it for those who are looking for an inexpensive alternative to a regular scanner.,4
its really cool. the only probalem is that when you have an alarm set on it once it goes off you can't get it to stop without turning off you device.  Also works good with kindly fire.,4
This app is great . L Ike to listen in on area's other than my own . Like watch the show cops only to tv . The list of places you can listen and tune into is quite large . Try it you might like it,4
"I LOVE THIS BECAUSE IT LETS ME KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND MY AREA, KEEPS ME SAFE, AND LETS ME KNOW WHEN SOMETHINGS GOING ON AND TO BE AWARE OF MY SURROUNDING HERE...IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT ONE CAN HEAR EVEN IF NOT SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THEIR SURROUNDING AREA....A THUMBS UP APP THAT IS VERY GOOD...",5
"App works well, but whoever runs the service does not pay attention to the fact that 80% of the time there is no audio.  It runs for hours with no one saying anything.  Does not seem to be a good method to tell them the audio is not working other than clicking &#34;no audio&#34;.  Volume seems to have only one level; can't turn it up.  Enjoy using it if there was some audio to listen to.",4
"I posted in the chat room a quote from a cable news network and was banned! By unprofessional moderators.I was just reporting the facts without any profanity, yet th chatters not stick yo the topic on hand. They chat about their personal life, etc.",1
"been using this app for a little while. don't expect anything live, since it streams from the internet there's about an half hour delay. good to pass time and hear what's going on.",4
"The scanner works well on my Kindle Fire.  I am able to tune into county and city PD , fire dispatch, etc.  It would be perfect if there was a way to control the sound other than volume.  When ever I am curious about  near by sirensI can tune into the action with scanner.",4
"This APP is really neat.  I was surprised to get local fire and police reception here in Medford, Oregon.  It can even be improved with very little cost.",4
"Tried several channels across my state and none were able to connect.  Most were offline.  Th is app was a good idea but I can't get it to work in my area.  Also, this 25 word minimum word review is stupid.",1
"Does not get police, maybe the highway patrol, but mainly the fire and ambulance. a little better than the other scanner you have, but not by much",3
I have this on my Kindle Fire and love it. I just keep it on in whatever room im in. I haven't. found a problem with battery drain.,5
"many more sites to check out so it gives  more rounded locations .One problem, I did not find a station closer than 15 miles from me ..",4
"This scanner app is the only one I have found that picks up the county police where I live.  They have recently moved to a digital format, and ordinary scanners will not receive them.  I do find that the audio is easier to understand if you use earphones instead of the tinny speakers in smart phones.  I also have this on my tablets also.",5
"It depends where you live on what channels you pick up. In my area I could only get the fire department, no police or sheriff's dept. So I deleted it.",2
Works good and lots of fun. Keep up with the action in your area. Hear the actual calls and activity,5
"I never expected this scanner to be so great. I pick up police, fire, EMS, railroads.....from my area and from several different states as well. And the reception is super clear. I bought a scanner for a few hundred dollars last year and returned it - it was terrible. But this free app on my Kindle Fire picks up everything and all I have to do is type in a city name or county! Easy, fun and free. No trouble with installing it or using it at all.I highly recommend it.",5
"an excellent way to be a nosy fly on the wall.  I didn't even know what a police scanner was before I downloaded this, but it's quite fun!  love the Top 50 stations, just listened to a high speed chase in chicago.",5
I have used this on my phone now it works great this way.,5
"Its really works, im in a city that's out away from a lot of big cities and i could tune into any city and listen to there scanner. I could hear about the floods they had last week before it was on the news (my city wasn't affected).  Really cool app!",5
"Cannot pick up any police, rescue, or fire in my area.  I was very disappointed!Hope they soon get an app that will pick up fire and rescue and police in my actual county or city!",2
This scanner app works extremely well. Our area recently converted to a digital and the app in my phone misses some of the action.,5
the product was alright. I was hoping it would have some closer stations to me. but it didn't but overall i think its a good product that can get the station they need,2
Great for keeping up on what's going on during bad weather in the area. The Broadcastify Alerts are great for listening in on emergencies around the world.,5
"Unfortunately, it does not scan the city I live in so it is not of much use.  But, there some interesting activity in the cities that do participate.  I do not have the time to listen to this scanner, but if you do, you will likely enjoy it.",3
I am very pleased with this purchase and will recommend this to my friends.  Good choice for me and satisfied with this choice.l,5
"App picks up WIFI easily and gives adequate coverage, although I wish they would add more stations.  I am satisfied with my purchase of this Kindle app.",4
Interesting program but unusable on the handset listed. Constant lockups and would hang up even on startup so virtually useless.,2
"I like getting alerts as to major events across the country, but especially in my area. Wish chat rooms hadn't been withdrawn though, as they were sometimes helpful.",5
"This app is amazing and FREE!! I could listen to this all night long. It picks up my local police station and you can't believe some of the stuff that goes on around town. The best time to listen to it is on weekends or holidays. It is very entertaining. Sometimes you just can't stop listening. Very addicting. There are complaints about it running down battery quickly, but I use this app on my kindle fire and it doesn't seem to use any more battery than any other open app. The other nice thing is that you can run this program in the background and still play other games or surf the Internet. I strongly urge you to give this app a try!",5
Awesome app for the kindle HD and it's free for your liking get it to night the full moon is out.,5
"Living in Hawaii, good app to have in case of emergency, as regards to weather info. Haven't picked up any local &#34;scans&#34;, although mainland and Australia come in loud and clear, on kindle fire hd.",3
This scanner is worth the time listening and is informational for my area as to the EMS/FIRE but not the Police in my community. Otherwise A-Ok.,3
"I was always a shortwave fan and had several good shortwave sets, including three Zenith TransOceanic radios and one fancy Panasonic.  I really loved sitting up at night and listening to the  broadcasts from around the world.  Part of the experience included listening to public band broadcasts from airports, police, ships and trains.  This allows me to listen to public band.  Works great.",5
I did not like this scanner.  no connections most of the time for my area and very very limited to channels for me,2
I am a police officer and the channels and stuff are Completely FAKE so don't waste your time you can find the same stuff online,1
I highly recommend this app. I live in Cincinnati and this app works perfect. I can tune in any time of the day and listen to what is going on in the city and the other small towns and cities close by. The only thing I wish this would have is the Greater Cincinnati Airport air traffic. This is a must have app for your Kindle.,4
"I tried one other scanner product before chosing this one, which offered coverage of services in Central NH, my region of interest.  Reception is GOOD on Kindle Fire!",4
"As a ham radio op, HazMat team member and CERT member, I need a good way to follow communications. Of the four apps tried, this is by far the best. Stores faves, updates regularly, configurable alerts built in. All excellent features.",4
apparently it must not be compatible with this tablet it said it was purchased but could not find it on the tablet,1
wellworked ok..didnt have many local frequencies but worked. Would not shut off even after pressed stop andclosed. had to force close from settings. VERY annoying.,2
"Um at first I used it for a while but, then I started not to use it quite as much as before & now it just seems to pretty much sit there in my tablet computer |[",2
"This free ""Scanner Radio"" app installed cleanly on my Kindle Fire HD and worked perfectly for my needs. The app does not turn your device into a radio but it does allow you to listen to Internet streaming of local government radio communications (police, EMS, etc). If your local service does not stream there communications, you will not be able to listen to them with this app.The interface was fairly easy to navigate and I was lucky to find that my local law enforcement's communication was available through the app.Recommended!CFH",5
I got this app to see what was going on in different places. Works great so far. Love it a lot!,5
free app that allows you to access local (and other) scanner radio stations.  very easy to use and to locate your local scanner stations.,4
Great app for home and away use to hear whats going on in the area your wondering about. I work in the LE FF EMS field and Have a portable radio but when you leave home and wanna know whats going on it works.,5
Local Gov't is switching to a new system. Lost my ability to monitor with a GRE scanner. Don't want to spend 500-dollars for a new scanner.  This is a great alternative for monitoring public safety channels locally.  Thanks for a great service.,5
"I really like this app. My husband is a retired policeman , and  I worked as a police dispatcher years ago. This app brings back old memories. The only problem I have with it is It doesn't pick up the city I live in. Not sure why,  I get citiesall around me. Even though I can't get my city it is fun to listen to.",5
scanner radio is the best police radio in the world I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you get to hear what's going on in your town or state.,5
This works like it is suppose to. I have gotten to listen to some towns I am not able to get on my regular scanner so I am very pleased with this,4
What a fun app.  The fact that there are so many options makes it fun to play with.  I've been listening to far away places.,5
I wanted one of these but this gave me a better Idea about a real one.  Thank you for this app,5
"I love this app. I can listen to the local area police and fire on my kindle, it is nice to know where the police and fire are going. :)",5
It really works! I have a kindle fire and it dosn't use much battery at all. I deffinently recomend this app.,5
"I downloaded it on my tablet, fast and simple. The only downfall I've noticed is when you tell it to search for scanners in your area, it takes forever to determine your location.  I just end up canceling it after a minute or two. But it's easy and simple to use.",4
"I live in a semi-rural county.  Wouldn't think much is going on around here, but with the suburbs on one end and farms on the other and several major roadways crossing the county, its busy.  And fascinating.  Enough for me to find the fire station numbers and listen for the sirens.  When nothing else is going on at home and I'm sitting horsing around on my computer, you can be sure that my phone is propped up next to me with this app running.  If I want to, I can choose many, many more local locations or big ones all around.  Still, for me its fun to listen locally.",5
"It works pretty good but damn are police scanners ect. boring to listen to, nothing ever happens and nobody is ever talking besides the odd code or whatever spoke into a scratchy sounding walky talky.",3
it does all different stations and you can listen to stuff going on in the world or near or in your area really good but sometimes the stuff that happens in the world will be unsettling but it is really what happens people are so sick and twisted not all but some hope this helps,5
wow it's so fun to listen to the police and rescue peeps it's almost like your being there. kinda scary when you hear something that is so close to your neighborhood.,4
this app is great! you have to where ear buds to listen though and if you stay on certain stations you can go to other apps and still here what's going on.,4
"Could not connect to any station, froze solid, forced me to have to reboot 2x to get my phone working again.  G'zone commando Froyo2.2",1
Our Emergency Management System just went digital and I was looking at spending between $400 & $600 for a new scanner. This app allows me to use my Kindle Fire as my new scanner until the cost of digital scanners comes down drastically.,4
This app was a free download and has tons of options. Covers areas even way up in Northern New York. Would recommend this one. Works on ASUS 10.1&#34; tablet.,5
My suburb isn't in the list of available scanners but Kansas City and Independence are and they are two of the larger Metro areas near where I live and there is plenty of action to listen to. Listening to police scanners is not for everyone I'm sure but my dad and I used to sit outside and listen to one on hot summer nights when I was a kid and I've been hooked ever since. It's probably a guy thing but I can imagine if a girl spent a bunch of summer nights listening to one with her dad  she may still enjoy it once in awhile. You can't beat the price - it's free. It's easy to use. I recommend it.,4
If you live in a larger city this APP might be ok but in northern Arkansas there isn't anywhere even close this will pick up.,3
"can here what's going on all over the country, and international also, plus your local police, which could come in handy.",4
"Very interesting, it really does work, I'm not sure about tryingto scan for your own area, because it kept loading forever until I gave up,but you can hear so many different cities.  Fire rescue, Police, very cool,makes you feel like your there.",4
"This app works great, I live in a very rural area so unfortunately there are no stations close enough for me but I am keeping this app anyways because when I travel I can see it would be very useful. I have it on my Kindle Fire & other than no GPS, which would have made it even more useful, it still works great. Recommend to get this app since you got here to read reviews, it interests you as it did me, and you will like it.",5
don't have access to listening to this a lot but when I do it is fun.  always something funny going on,4
"This app is ok, not sure it will do me much good.  Need to work with it some more before I decide.",3
"I have a trunking scanner (analog), but can't listen to the APCO 25 systems that almost all of the police departments have moved to. This app allows me to listen to these systems (one at a time), so it's nice not to have to purchase a $400 scanner just to add one department.",5
"This app seems to work just great. All of the local municipal and state frequencies in my area are lumped into one single monitor frequency in my area though. I thought I would try this app just to see how well it works and it does. I have both a base station scanner in my house and a hand held scanner for mobile use when I go on trips but i'll bet they haven't been turned on more than ten or fifteen times in the years that I've had them. Listening to scanner calls as a steady diet is somewhat distracting to me. As a point of reference I was a licensed ham radio operator and CB radio operator. I never put my mobile transceiver in my car at all any more nor turn on my base station radio transceiver anymore either. I don't think my base station transceiver's antenna coaxial cable is even hooked up to the radio anymore as well. For you scanner junkies out there the Scanner Radio app will work just fine on your tablet or android phone and you can listen to scanner calls to your heart's content. One of my best friends is a consummate scanner monitor listener and has his scanners running all of his waking hours at home. In any event, happy listening on the Scanner Monitor app to the rest of you.",5
"I can and already have had a ball with this app. This is a great one to listen to from agencies around the world. This is well worth the effort to get if you like to be ""nosey"" with what's going on in other cities and countries.",5
"Scanner fanatics will love this app.  Keep track of local fire and police activity, as well as events all over the country.  You can hear the action at police chases or natural disasters just about anywhere.  You can set alerts for your favorite channels.",5
"I didn't like it it didn't work right. I took it off of my kindle right away.Couldn't hear it right.  I like something I can enjoy listing to,  I think you need to improve this app. maybe some day I will get it again, when I am sure it works",1
Turn this on when you hear sirens to find out what the emergency is. Turn it on when you are bored and find out what kind of trouble people are getting into.,3
Could not seem to get it working on anything local to where I actually live.  Another one of those &#34;seemed like a good idea at the time&#34; things.,3
"While this app might be useful in major cities, it isn't at all useful in small towns.  The audio streams are from voluntary sources, it is NOT like having a real scanner receiver.",2
This app is easy to set up and use. Favorite stations can be saved and listened to whenever wanted. Stations can be found for just about any town or county.,5
Over all it works great and it has a quite a few locations to monitor.. Hope more will be added in the future for Florida..This could be a life saver during hurricane seasons..Road notifications for emergencies....,4
"i love listening to freq. that are always transmitting interesting stuff.....LA, Chicago, Las Vegas/Reno, or DCreally cool APP. great for all EMS/FF",5
"It pulled up 20+ stations for my area but I never received any audio - even though the app occasionally indicated that content was streaming. Played around with it for 10 minutes before giving up & uninstalling.The UI is intuitive and the features appear fairly robust (although some are only available in the paid version). If it had worked for me I'd likely give it at least 4 stars.Nexus One, Android 2.3.3 Build #GRI40, ""Gingerbread""TMobile, U.S.",1
"My son works as policeman in a neighboring county. With this app, I can keep up with him. It was really easy to use and set up.",5
"This scanner is a good idea for an app, but it crashes constantly.  Every time I click on something it freezes up and then promptly shuts down.",1
"very useful DroidX, scanner pro has been awesome for listening in random places like from New Mexico to Utah! (buy the pro version invest in the future of this app!) has made my DroidX pleasant again i seriously have over 340 app's installed in my phone DroidX greatest phone ever. look me up on appaware.com/user/name/dyingjedi or appbrain.org/user/dyingjedi/apps-on-the-motorola-droid-x",5
"i would like to have the city i live in on here. is there a way to add or what? someone please help. the city is elmira ny,  if that helps",2
"It is not what I expectedit does not function as advertised, not for me anyhowno matter the time or place there is emptiness.",2
Don't use it. Couldn't get anything too clear.  Depends on where you live I suppose.  Someone else would have better luck.,1
I love this app! I'm amazed that it doesn't eat up a lot of battery power even during simultaneous reading &amp; game playing activities on my Kindle Fire! I would give it 5 stars if there were more local or rural broadcast channels.,4
It great radio sound good have lot of stations. Wish it our depts and ones around me I call it A plus,5
i have owned this for a long time now and am finally doing a review. this scanner app works fine on the kindle fire good luck finding a station in a specific area. works fine though and fun to listen to.,5
"I can't wait for more channels! I am a paramedic, and love listening to calls when I'm off-duty. I would love it if there were more international channels. Good job! Great app!",5
"Great little application for my area to keep you in the know of what is happening in my city.  Please note, not all cities and towns are on there tho.",5
This one works very well in my area.  Unbelievable how many calls you hear on this app and gives you idea of what is going on around your town,5
"It works well, and does what it says. The only drawback is, there are not stations available in every city, so your city may not be aired. Fun to listen to at night. Has a.sleep timer.",5
kindle must be fully on to receive the broadcasts.  even plugged in does not seem to work..  will uninstall it,2
"It offers many radio stations and is very easy to use.  Only complaint is that most of my local stations don't appear, which I am sure is not the developers fault, but what is there is nice.  Can't really expect much more for a free app but it is a nice item.",4
"This is good if you're interested in what's going on in your area (or someplace else).  As I live near several schools and shopping areas, I find this useful.",5
"I no longer have this app on my phone but when I did download it, I used it as a novelty when I had nothing better to listen to.",3
"Great app to listen to police, paramedic and fire department radio broadcasts around the United States. I have used it many times and have listened to chases, explosions and family disputes resulting in gunfire. Shows you how the police and other professionals have to deal with the dregs of society.",5
battery and usage drain on my cell phone mobile phone.  Thid app scanner radio will drain your battery and scanner radio will use up your allowable mobile phone data usage.,1
"Don't know if its this app or my kindle but I listen to the scanner covering north Flint, Mi.  Yeah, pretty busy.  But it'll go quiet and I find its turned itself off.",3
This app is very cool and does what it says. I found channels from all over my area... Last weekend I heard a call for a fire less than a block away before the sirens even went off! Works great on my Samsung Droid Charge and Kindle Fire,5
I cant tell if its just the people that made this talking.or if its just real police. but after all it is good,5
It's nice that the developer is able to consolidate many channels so the listener does not have to monitor each individually. It's clear and free entertainment. LOL!,5
"The app is awesome and worked great up until my local police department went off-line for the app. I do not know why, but I did enjoy the app up until then.",5
"As a former dispatcher I have always been hooked on listening to police calls. This app is beyond what I ever thought was out there. You can get local calls, state calls ...even calls from around the USA or the world. It is a totally amazing app.",5
I live near 2 major metropolis and couldn't get a single station to come in...this app was uninstalled within 30 minutes of downloading. Looked forward to this so needless to say I'm disappointed.,1
This is very addictive. There are so many great scanners to listen to. The most popular scanner always seems to be the Chicago Police.,5
I didn't expect this to pick up local emergency transmissions but the price was right to find out.Local transmissions do come across clearly.,5
"Sorry could not write a review, did not keep it long enogh to rate this product.I think I'll stay away from the scanner radios.",2
I call it fun and informative. This app let's you listen to emergency services in multiple places and you can control exactly where and how loud you want it to be. I've really had fun with it and I didn't have to go spend hundreds on a scanner. Thanks.,4
I only wish there were more areas covered but I am sure that is not the fault of the programmer.,4
"some one in my city needed to be the main monitor so others could receive the radio cities... what you need is to make an app that doesnt need a human to be there... just download it and play...just like HAM SPHERE radio... where you can talk to other participants around the world.... now, that's real virtual radio..... YOUR SCANNER SUCKS BIG TIME.",1
I really like this app!!! And..to top it off..it was free!!! The only thing I don't like about it is I have it on my Kindle Fire which I love..but it only stays on for so long then cuts off...then I have to reopen it..I wish it would stay on as long as I have it opened...would help a lot during bad weather!! For this I give Four (4) stars..if this problem can be fixed I'll be happy to give five (5) stars!!! If anyone knows how I can take care of this problem please please let me know..you can email me at ginaricec3@Yahoo.com.  Thanks!!!,4
Ever hear a bunch of sirens and wonder what's going down?This is basically a police scanner that you can link to your local PD and hear dispatch and other communications.I had it on one evening when our PD were searching for a robbery suspect. I decided not to go to the supermarket that night.,3
"Scanner Radio is a wasted program. Shortly after downloading it, I used it, and even shorter after that, I deleted it. It is a very heavy program that once downloaded, starts sending you constant spam from their contributors. I deleted the program because of how inconvenient it was to use and had to block the flood of email traffic that shortly ensued. I would caution anyone from downloading this app to use.",1
doesn't scan your local police/fire channels.  I could really care less about what is going on 45 minutes from where I live.,2
"I love this app. It allows me to know what the sirens I hear are all about. I can hear the local police, emergency and fire traffic. I have been able to hear of incidents happening in my own neighborhood which allows me to feel safer. I know what is going on and where the troubled spots are and when. When I hear of breaking national news I can look for a frequency in the area effected and can listen to events as they happen. I had an old style scanner when my children were teens and loved hearing the goings on. Now scanners have gone high tech and are available over your computer, Kindle, and even smartphones.",5
"I have tried this thing at different times and with different &#34;cities&#34;, etc.  I have not been able to hear even one word.  It's like the whole program has been abandoned.  Mostly likely it has.  Don't waste your time.",1
"I was hoping that I could get my local police district on it, but it is not available. I will use this app occasionally.",3
It's nice to have the scanner but when the kindle automatically times out so does the scanner so you always have to re-start the kindle.,4
This app has been a lot of fun. You can listen to police and other emergency services all over the country as well as your local area. I listen to it all the time. Very handy to have.,4
Couldn't find my county didn't have good stations that I even wanted I ended up toke it off my device,1
I had to remove it as I found out that I live in a very dull city.  I guess that is really great!!  I waited and in an hour there were 2 contacts between the dispatcher and a patrol officer.  One about a lost dog and another about some trash.  Each was about 10 seconds.  It did kind of startle me when I heard it.  I thought it best just to remove it.  You may live in a city that has an interesting climate or you are a criminal and want to know when they are coming to your door but that is not me.  Try it you may need it or just enjoy hearing what happening!,5
It does work but many areas have limited possibilities.  Only a couple of frequencies picked up in my area and the sound quality was poor.  I found this boring after a while and uninstalled it.,3
I got this app to listen to fire and rescue. a very good app. I have had no problems with it at all. I am going to buy the pro one of this app so I get rid of the ads.,4
it is really cool to be listening to the police it is very intrrasting to be listening to police talk,5
Great app worked great with my kindle. I have used it alot sence I have put it on my kindle.,5
"Do not get this scanner application, it does not receive the stations I was looking for.  Glad it was free, have deleted it of the device and the cloud.",1
"works ok, but please state adware in description. ok 20 words - kindle fire fail. sheesh. nice day today I think",3
"It does exactly what it says.  The sound quality is as good as one would expect.  It is easy to navigate and intuitive to use.  Worked perfectly on my EVO 4G.  No complaints, but not much to add, either.",5
It provides some interesting places to hear what's going on. I expectedmore activity but I guess things are slow a lot of the time.,3
"Using on my Kindle fire, the volume is not as loud as I would like it. It has it's moments, but as a new kindle owner it's fun to try the stuff out.",4
"First let's make one thing clear. The application has NO control over what channels are available. The people rating it 1 star need to read.The scanner itself works great. It uses an online provider to get its data, which receives its data from individual enthusiasts.It is great to use for killing the time or listening to local events. It may be a data hog but there isn't really an easy way around it from a code point of view. Nonetheless, this application is worth the increased data use. If you have a wifi connection of unlimited data like myself there really is no reason to avoid downloading this application.",5
"I have been using one version or another of this app for years.  i love being able to hear sirens etc and know what is going on.  but the app is only as good as the depertments that are on it.  More urban areas if you search have more going on and better decriptions, more rural, obviously not as much going on, but sometimes the radios sound worse etc.  but great thing to have if u like to know whats going on.",4
"I just wanted to see if it works and it does. I took it off because I don't know if it might be illegal in this state as most everything probably is here. Have no use for it anyway. It works and can be adjusted to many different areas at least where I am located. I didn't know so many people were jabbering on the radio so much. I heard Fire, Police and a lot of unidentifiable jabber talk going on even late in the night. An old Ham or CB operator that knew the lingo would enjoy this thing. A friend of mine works in the Fire Department so I will have to find out if I can have this without cops going goofy on me somehow for some reason. Might be useful in an emergency?",3
"The app works, but it gets the radio transmissions from people who are streaming it through their computer so if a &#34;handler&#34; isn't broadcasting or having issues with their ISP then you don't get anything.  It's ok, we use it to listen to the local police and NYCPD.",3
"It's fun, but not always busy. You can listen to big city scanners they are more entertaining. If you like scanners I think you will enjoy this app.",4
like this. now I don't have to be in dark of what is happening in neighborhood or around where I live.,4
I love this app. I get to hear what is going on all around town. This is an amazing free app. I haven't had any issues yet!,5
"I paid for the pro version to support the developer on the google market, and unfortunately I would have to pay again on the amazon market to use the pro version. That aside, it is a good app. It works well. I wish my state (MA) had more locations, but I realize it is not so simple and requires a server.",5
"It works but does not have a left right speaker filter.  I prefer the Scanner 911 Free - Police Scanner and Police Radio, Fire Radio that has the ability to separate the local fire / police",4
This is a great app if you are into this. You can listen for hours just about anywhere you want. It even shows emergencies as they happen.,4
"It comes on, it has white noise and it has multiple stations to target, however I am still yet to receive the first  actual results.",3
"Well after reviewing at least ten different apps within two weeks I finally get to this. Hey everybody want to know what police and firefighters are up to? Then you need scanner radio free at the App store. This app works with the help of wi-fi the thing that most of the world depends on. If you want to know what is going on near you, you can search on the search selection and type in your state, country, city, or zip code and all you have to do is choose one out of the many options that pop up. This app has no lag and will keep you on alert so you know where the bad boys are. So what are you waiting for? The world to end. I don't think so. Its time to get this app because it has your name on it saying download me. Chill out and relax with scanner radio.",5
"This App is Great! I'm a New Yorker, living in Florida, and with this app I can keep in touch with my Home City! There's a lot to listen to, and you can add Favorites. I Love it! I also listen in to other states & other countries. It work Great! Sound is Clear as a Bell!",5
Works great on the HTC Incredible. I spend maybe to much time listening to the nearby cities since mine is not available yet. Just a lot of fun.,4
Very happy to find Tucson and EMS on Scanner Radio.  Thanks to Gordon Edwards for putting this together.  I often have it on as background noise.,5
The scanner works very well. I was able to listen to the emergency calls here. I heard police and ambulance. There was no fires going on so did not hear them.,5
"I was able to hear what the local police where saying over the radio, and this app works perfectly!thanks!",5
It may be a great app if you have the elements needed to make it work.  I did not and removed it.  A good idea though.  I wish it worked.,2
"Some apps are good,some bad,some work,some do not!I do/did not like this app because I want a scanner for my town,not a town that is 30,40 or 50 miles away !!!",1
I LIVE IN WASHINGTON STATE AND THERE ARE 4 FREE COUNTIES AND THERE ARE 46 IN THE PRO VERSION THAT YOU CAN BUY AND MY COUNTY IS IN THOSE NOT THE FREE ONE!! IT;S FREE SO CAN'T COMPLAIN!!,3
I'm very happy with this app so Syfy people should try it out I will recommend you to other people to try this at,5
"Absolutely is not what I expected.  I do not live in a small city,  but it only picks up in areas miles from me, no local.  I can do without this app.",2
"This app is a lot of fun on a cell phone but it's even more fun to watch on your GoogleTV!! A lot of times when I have people over I'll put this app on in the background and we'll just socialize or have some drinks and every once in a while we hear some action that we get into. It's really cool as well that you can search the world for a city's radio to listen to. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is beucase on the free version, there are certain featuers that are lacking. i.e. you can't use the &#34;play/pause/stop&#34; button at the top of the screen unless you pay for it but you can still hit the back button and do the same thing if you want it to stop. :)",4
"This is a So-So app. Not much on the flashy side. Basic scanner, good sound quality, but nothing special. Get it if you just want to try one out.",5
"Unlike some other scanner apps this one actually works. Great features such as saving favorites, archives, a sleep timer, area maps, chat rooms, and a 10-codes reference make this the best scanner app going.",5
"Works great on my Kindle Fire HD.  If you want to listen to what's going on in your area, this is a good one to choose.",5
would be a good app but there are not enough cities and states available.  the closest to my locationn was 90 miles away and no state police available,2
"LIke this app and found it quite helpful during a recent storm.  Since free wifi is available in many places, it was helpful for the weather radio.  Do keep in mind that if you are serious about accessing weather radio, it probably best to buy one for that specific purpose.  Wifi is pretty dicey in emergency situations.",5
On my Kindle Fire this thing works great. By far my favorite app. to date. So many different stations.  I be surprised if u didn't find your town. Love It!!!!,5
"I always know where my loved ones are and now when the whistles go off, i can relax after hearing the problem isn't with any of them.",5
"I like the scanner radio.  It tends to go off the air quite a bit, but when it is working it is fun to listen to.",4
now this is a good one.  Too bad I have to repeat myself in order to submit a review but it is good,5
Love it lots of fun I will have more with it when I have more time but 2thumbs up from me,5
"This app works great, has loads and loads of stations/channels to pick from based all around the country. Good sound quality and very simple to use",5
"it works as a scanner, but it wasn't too fun of an app and you have to keep listening for any calls.  I like the online reports that have text history which is faster to review.",3
"I can't believe that this app is free! I use radioreferences.com on my computer which I thought was cool, but the fact that I can take my Kindle anywhere and get info right where I am is so amazing. My husband likes to find radio operators in other countries. You can be listening while playing games or surfing the internet too. Thanks to the developer of this app!",5
I love this scanner app.  I prefer it to my real scanner as it's so uncomplicated to use.  Highly recommended.,5
Curiosity made me get this!  I enjoy turning on my Kindle Fire when I hear sirens in my small town to hear what's going on!  I always hear folks talking about what they heard &#34;on the scanner&#34; and now I know why!  Ads are very nonobtrusive,4
"I have two police scanners at home but it always annoyed me when I would hear sirens while outside of the house.  With this app, I'm able to tune in and find out where the emergency vehicles are going and why.  I love it!",5
"I like this so far , just wish I could my local weather conditions better.that is why I wanted this.",4
"This was the first app I put on my Evo and it has only gotten better and better. Love the sleep timer and all the features. Dev is wonderful at replying to emails, usually within hours. Awesome!",5
This is a decent app that could definitely benefit from some time with a developer for some updates. I live in a fairly rural area and there is only 1 station near me that is on the list. It is our county sherrifs. I wish there was an eaiser way to pick up specific traffic from the city PD and such so I can know what is going on in my exact location.,3
Does have our local stations and it is easy to navigate.We don't listen to often but it makes for an interesting evening sometimes.,3
"It's definitely a great time passer. Interesting to hear what you hear, for sure. You never know what's going on everywhere, but most of all there are several hundred locations to listen to. A great scanner for the interested mind.",4
"Configure alerts and find out what's happening and where!  Since she moved to Florida, it's the only replacement I've found for my 70-year-old neighbor--who had 4 old-school police scanners!  And loved to keep me informed!  Now I feel that way again.  Thanks, George!",5
Does not work for me.  Was not what I expected in a scanner App.  Tried it and it was not what I expected.  Removed from my Kindle.,2
"This app works better than my real scanner! Not only can I hear my area, but listen to other places. You can even set alerts for when a channel say has over 150 listeners so you are where the action is. I'm finding this app to be the best out there that I've tried!",5
"I have never had a scanner or listened to fire/police broadcasts before, so this is great fun.  there are a lot of codes and messages I don't understand, but little by little I'm learning.  The app works great and it's cool to listen to other cities.  I'm very pleased.",5
"It works very well.  The clarity is quite good.  I like the Idea that you can listen to police, fire, marine and air.  \If you into monitoring agencies this unit is just right for you.",4
"I have enjoyed this product. Easy to scan local police,fire and rescue. convient not having to have a seperate radio just use your tablet(kindle).",4
I tried this one first and it is the plain Jane version. I later upgraded to the Pro edition for larger database and more features.,5
"most areas i have tried it at does not work at all or eithervery poorly. i would not waste my time with it, i have yet tofind a scanner app that works decently.",1
"I like listening to police and fire and EMTS in my town, the problem with this app it use alot of power, however I enjoy using it anyway on my cell phone and on my PC, I always recomend this scanner app to my friends.",5
"if you like hearing what is going on in your neighborhood, you will like this. you get to hear things as soon as they happen",5
"Scanners are always good for a little fun. This app is definitely entertaining if you want to know what's going on around your town, or any town for that matter. I constantly have mine on.",4
"I had a hard time finding something for my area and when I did, very static and broken up. Maybe would be fine in a different area.",1
This is one of my favorite APPs. I can listen to local Police scanner area as I use my Kindle. I was going to buy a scanner as I became addicted to my neighbors and now I don't have to. Loveitloveitloveit. I know so much now that is going on around me. Very entertaining!,5
It is not what I expected but I have it and it is kind of fun to mess with and listen to. If you are a Scanner Radio person then this is the item you would want.,3
I really like this app. I live out in the boonies and picked it up  on a whim hoping that my area would be included or even be picked up by it. Low and behold there we were! This is a keeper!,5
I love this app it is very fun and a good time waster and you can listen to the police and It really works and I am useing it right now!,5
"Who would have thought this app existed.  It's ok I guess, it really just depends on where you live and what you are looking to hear on this app.  I would listen in to be nosy and see what kind of 'action' was going on around the city; sometimes I will check out NYC or Chicago or whatever...also, we had some wildfires close to town this summer and I would listen in on the fire dept. channel at times to see if I heard anything the news wasn't putting out.  Many times when the channels get busy they overlap and it's hard to understand.  I have downloaded this on my Kindle and on my Samsung Blaze...both worked fine.  Cheap entertainment app. :)",5
it would be awesome if it had my local information..  the best I get is near 50 miles away...  doesn't really help me to know what's going. good on everywhere else....  i had an issue needing police attention and could not find them anywhere..  had it been on.  the scanner we would have known if they were at least on their way.  or if they had caught the man breaking into homes half block away.,3
"Scanners are from users that are on Broadcastify. I can listen to scanners in my area for free, or I can listen to a broadcast from another state. Lots of areas to choose from. I've had no problems with it at all.",5
"but to be honest i didnt expect it to because i live in the country, i pick up no stations at all",1
You might be disappointed as nets and organizations have to participate for u to hear. Like I thought I could listen to my husband's local HAM but they are not on just a net in the South. I could not hear police traffic just EMS. It is cool just that u can do it but I am not using it everyday.,4
i never could find any station to play where i live or driving. waste of time. not good for people who do not live in cities!,1
"I was amazed at all of the available stations.  I get to listen to local stations and ones from my hometown.  The only thing I'm a bit disappointed in is that I can't listen to multiple stations at once. (But maybe one can, I just didn't figure it out yet then.)",4
The reason I am only giving this app 2stars is because I can't get access to scanning anywhere near my area,2
Set it for my area and have never worked no matter how many times Ive downloaded and deleted it then reloaded it. Sucks !,1
This is a great scanner and has way more stations to listen to than the others I have tried. And has a lot of my own city stations.,5
"While I frequently listen in to my local channels,  I also enjoy eavesdropping in on other countries now &amp; again. Even when I can't understand the language.",5
don't waste your time downloading. there is nothing on here. I heard a bunch of weird noises coming from it but that was it. Maybe I'm way out of range but I just didn't see the point of keeping it. I uninstalled it as fast as I could.,1
"This app does not work even half of the time and it is very laggy on people talking, you can not even understand them.",1
"not bad. it is not the Dev  decision what departments broadcast, so don't rate low if your area is lame.",4
"I'm no communications technician, but don't live scanning require at least a mobile scanner and reasonable antenna to get the live feeds?  I tried it for my area and it only chose certain available channels that were being netcast.  I'll have to do more research to see if this actually is broadcasting live feed.If you know for sure comment on here.  In the mean time, I'll ask my local precinct if this is accurate.",5
"I probably won't use this.  My neighbor was a dispatcher and finds this app to be highly entertaining, but I just find it hard to  understand and don't really have much interest in the content being transmitted.  I am new at this app thing, and have made a few choices that really do not apply to my interests,",3
"Bought this for my Kindle Fire and was surprised at how clearly it comes in. There's a wide selection of areas to listen to. It's so cool, I'm going to upgrade to the pro version.",5
"Have used this a number of times in various locations and it works great, just like a regular scanner.  Reception is clear, good volume, and does a great job rotating from one source to the other.The Keystone Kid",5
I liked that I can customize this app to fit my listening preferences. It's very easy to use and adds some fun to my Kindle Fire. I was able to program my local police dept. and fire dept.,5
"I Thought this was a good app, but I only received one frequency in my area.  When I found this&#34;ARCHIVES&#34;of frequencies,which I could use if I subscribe to some other program,I lost interest in this app.  GOODBYE!!",2
"I was able to pick up my local police, fire, and ambulance.I always wanted to buy a real one of these, but they arevery hard to find anymore... plus, online, they are very expensive.So, this app is awesome!!!!!  I don't listen to it nearly enough.We always have tons of sirens going everywhere and alwayscurious as to what happened, but I don't use this that often.If I did, I know that I would satisfy my curiosity.",5
"Excellent app, lots of stations, although small town/county options may be limited as it is based on users streaming the radio.",5
I say its great if you have no radio in ur room I say one best apps I ever got I would spend 20 dollars on it,5
"I love the game and I used to play it on bored.com all the time, but now it has a touchscreen version! Count me in! I just wish there were more levels to play.",4
Awesome. Takes me back to childhood when everyone had a scanner! I just wish I knew what all the codes were these days.,5
Could only hear it with headphones and really does not offer the music I like in an easy to find format.,2
Have not tried this app just yet but still have it on my kindle.  I am sure it won't be exactly as I thought it to be but sure it will be interesting none the less.,3
I was looking for an app that I could listen to the police scanner.  I have some friends who were able to listen to the police scanner during a very intense police chase and hostage situation in our area.  So I went looking for a similar app and was hoping this was it.  It's not even close! I'm lucky if I hear anything but static. I was very disappointed in this.,2
This app works very well. Great to listen to while at work. Hopefully more scanner channels will be added soon. Check it out and enjoy!,5
"Works like a charm.  Gives you 80% of the functionality of a $300 scanner, for free!  I live in a town of 4000 in Vermont, and this app even had my town on its access list.  Impressive.",5
will not connect to anything even on wifi no local in city not out n sticks has trains but y listion to them talk,1
"This app seems to be well executed.  Regrettably, only one channel is available for my area.  If I want to listen to radio traffic in other places it seemed to work pretty well though.",3
They did a great job of doing this game but there are the best ways to search physce there is one search but GREAT MUST HAVE,5
"I'm fortunate to have RadioReference.com volunteers who broadcasting important feeds from my neighborhood.  My handheld transceiver has good range, but still doesn't pick up as much as the area police feed provided online.  Many areas I visit often have numerous feeds available, and is also helpful when I want to program frequencies into my transceiver.  I'm definitely planning on going Pro so I have access to more features, but the free version of this app is very feature rich and stable.  It does eat up the battery pretty quickly, even with earbuds, but I have plenty of adapters to keep my phone powered up.  I'm very pleased with the RadioReference.com Scanner Radio app, and heartily recommend it to an scanner enthusiast.",5
"This is a pretty much self explanatory app.  You set it up per your user preferences, if you are originally from say......Kansas City, Kansas, and you're living in LA now, you can set this app up to get broadcasts from Kansas City PD, the fire dept, weather, even amateur radio repeaters from your home town.  This is one of those apps that has its place for all of us that wish we were part of the action, but glad we're not.  After 25+ years in law enforcement, and have owned several scanners in my time, and although I don't currently own the latest in a digital spread spectrum top of the line scanner.  I still have a digital scanner in my pocket thanks to scanner radioYa gotta love those guys and gals who of there own free will take the time to set up there own scanners and allow those of us that want to listen can listen.  I would hazard a guess that most of us have a favorite or two or three set frequencies if you will, well, with this app, you can set up your favorites list and you can just pick and chose which one you want to listen to for the first hour or two.  Or maybe one of your favorites is quiet tonight, you take a chance and see whats going on in the land down under, yep, we can listen to the brave men and women in uniform in Australia.  While its no hand held scanner that you can set up, program, have an antenna on the roof of your home and all, bt this isn't a bad substitute, try it, couldn't hurt, you may just be the next action junkie.  Have fun with this, don't become an ambulance chaser, you may wind up being the topic of discussion for that evening, not sayin, just sayin, be smart and be safe, enjoy the app for what it is.",4
"3-25-13 -- I've always wanted a police scanner but they were too costly.  Kudos to the designer and to the volunteers who lend their scanners to provide this app.  The coverage of local police, fire and EMT service seems excellent, and the small ads are not too intrusive.  The site is very easy to navigate and a list of police codes is included.  There is even an archive if you want to review prior dates, but it requires a paid subscription so I haven't checked it out.  I find it hard to tear myself away from the live police chatter, even though it's usually quite routine.  Update 4-27-13 -- The alerts accurately tell you when there are more listeners than usual in a certain area.  Today I listened in on Australia loud and clear.  I'm impressed!",5
This works as promised.  Good selection of frequencies.  User interface us simple and Intuitive to use.  I have no complaints.  Good job!,5
"Can not even pick up the city I live in and I am three blocks from fire, rescue and police.  Waste of time and money.",1
they don't talk much in Dade County and I don't know the codes so deleted it from kindle oh well,3
A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free.,4
Does everything it says! Scans all different frequencies!! Reminds me of when I was a child except this is digital with favorite's.  LoLMust download!!,5
I really enjoy this. I wanted a scanner sooo much when i was a kid. Lots of area and state choices. I have it on phone and tablet!,5
"I was unable to access anything on this app.  Maybe I just don't understand how it works, but even for free, I dumped it.",1
"This is another app that i cannot go without, I live in an area where we get fires, and this app is amazingly helpful, and i don't have to carry a scanner with me, all i have to do is start the app and select the channel and i'm listening just like that,this app does everything from citizen to fire and police and rescue channels, If you want to know what is going on around you but either don't own a scanner, or don't want to carry one this app is for you!",5
"For those that don't have a police scanner and like to make sure things are ok in your neighborhood this is the app for you. And hey its mobile and FREE!!!!  You just select your county and walah.....you have info for what's happening with the police, fire department,  and the EMT 's. And you will be the first to know of anyone you know is in trouble....going to jail,  being pulled over, accident,  and on and on. Enjoy it. Love You Love Nora",5
"Cumbersome and not really useful.  I tried it, then took if off.  Maybe i just can't take the time to mess with it.",2
I was impressed at the ease of installation and how well it does receive on my Kindle Fire H D.,4
"Scanner works well on Kindle Fire. Buffering pauses the scans, but overall a good app. Lots of locations to choose from",5
"I used to be a dispatcher &amp; tho't this would be the answer to my prayers since moving to another state BUT my area isn't included. One that is, is a MUCH smaller town. And mine is a large city even. Will keep app to see if reception improves. Glad everyone is happy w/ theirs tho. Enjoy!!",3
I like the fact that if I need to know why traffic is backed up or there are sirens all around my neighborhood I can get info without having to wait for news the next day. Would be better if there was less static.,4
I got this to try to keep track of all the fire trucks that go by and get absolutely nothing. Tried to change directions and frequency but get no audio at all.,2
This litle radio scanner is so neat.You can access local scanning and other areas.It is great to find out whats going on in your area or other areas.This is a neat little appTry it...you will like it!,5
works to a point but not in all area's you may want to scan. could be blocks on government scanner doing it or it's filtering design either way it doesn't always do want you might need it to do.,2
"Nothing in California. At least not in Sacramento or the surrounding area. They are supposed to be expanding, but I listened to other areas for fun and found it to be very poor sound quality.",1
This app works wonderful on my Kindle Fire. Always have excellent reception. I use this app everyday and have never had any issues. It does exactly what it says.,5
"A lot of static, hard to move up the sound tab, can't find a way to make it a Favorite.",3
My personal scanner only reaches out about 60 miles.This app is so user friendly.I enjoy listening to other cities once in a while.The app I downloaded was the pro version so farthis is by far the best scanner app out there.,5
well j just install and do not open it.but I wanna create. the comment before openning it. yeah it must be a good app when I was sleeping.,5
"Good enough for someone who wants it for ""amateur"" reasons, but it is to laggy for me as a professional to use as a third radio frequency.",2
"The app works well, but offers only a very limited selections of agencies in my local area.  Large metro areas probably will have a larger selection of agencies to monitor.",3
exceptional on line scanner works as advertised. many police area ssupportedthis should be valuable info for determining traffic jam causes etcreccomended,5
Nice toy and tool for beginner and advanced enthusiast.Would like to see more channels like state police and marine channels.,5
"This is a fun app. There are many stations. However, there could be a lot more. You may not be able to get all local stations, but you should be able to get near your area.",4
I live in a major metropolitan area and this program does not connect to anything in my area. I have try it a few times but to me it is useless.,1
It is useless. I could not get my local police on here. All I got was static and if you don't live in a big city just forget it.,1
This works quite well.  We live along a major road and we have used it in the past to determine if the fire trucks zooming past our house will be blocking our travels or if it is safe to go on the route we chose.,5
I've never had a police scanner before. This is really cool to listen to. I love listening to my local scanner but it is also so cool that you can listen everywhere else as well.,4
Really like this app feels like im a kid again visiting my grandma she always had a scanner running in the kitchen,4
"Can't find any listings for my town, and only one listing for my part of Texas.  The sound is very low and I can't seem to get it any higher.  Most of this is proberly my fault.  Sorry just can't give a good rating for this scanner",3
I have this app on every Android device and computer in the house.  This app lets me scan public safety calls in my home town even though I live 1600 miles away.  Definitely a must have.,5
I love hearing what is going on around me..It just took me a few times to find the right one for my area. This is awesome try it.,5
"Fun to listen to while doing other things, though where I live there is really not much going on.  If you live in a big Metro City you may hear some interesting stuff.  Probably have used/listened to 1/2 dozen times in abt 6 months.  No big deal here.",3
this app is great and very useful . i lke being able to have access to scanners for no cost,5
Scanner works well. UI isn't the greatest but it gets the job done. Was surprised at the amount of channels available.I recommend this is you're looking for a scanner.,5
"wasnt as exciting as i hoped,  i took it off after messing around with it for awhile,  not much else to say",3
I couldn't find transmission of signals in my local area.  I suppose otherwise this would be OK but for me it wasn't worth it.,2
"So this app doesn't really replace having a real police scanner, but its definitely entertaining to listen to. I like the GPS settings that find the broadcasts around you, and the alert function is kinda cool, if a set amount of people tune into a police band it will alert you, theory is if 100 people are listening at once something exciting is probably going on.  The feeds this app use are actually available to listen to for free online, but it is a cool user interface for your smart phone.",4
"I didn't think it was going to be all that interesting, but listening to how the emergency crews of the PD and FD handle different situations turned out very interesting!",4
why buy a scanner when you can listen to one free on this app!!!!  why buy a scanner when you can listen to one free on this app!!!!,5
Works very well. We are able to listen to most local communications on the public service channels. It is certainly cheaper than purchasing a scanner and provides the occasional listener with usable easy access.,3
This app can't find a major city that has a lot of listeners inside 5 minutes. Totally a waste of time.,1
It is actually kind of cool to be able to listen in on the police scanners. lol....I have a son who drives so I keep it on when he is out to listen to our local police to make sure he is not in an accident. Got to love being an over-anxious mom.,5
Its okay but it doesn't have my area (district) on there.Other than that I would give it 5 stars but It is still interesting to here other things going on around or beyond.,3
I did not like this app at all. The scanner hardly picked up anything- even when I switched channels. This app is not for me.,2
My husband has turned into a scanner stalker. He loves listening to all the commotion going on around our city.,5
Ever see a cop car race by and wonder what's going on?  Now you can listen to emergency radio calls without buying a real scanner.,5
This so-called radio was a piece of junk.  poor quality and lousy sound...not even what I would expect from the chinese these days.,2
My spousal unit and I use this all the time. We live up high over the city and can see for miles and miles. Whenever we see flashing lights we turn this app on and listen to the local action. Very fun!,5
I thought when I got this that I can hear what was going on around my neighborhood but it didn't allow that.,1
this app is really good. I can listen to lots of different police stations. so if there is a chase going on i can hear about......you should get it!!!!!!!! :) ;),4
Not able to get the program to work very often SEEMS IS OFF THE AIR MORE THAN ONMake sure to check out w/ test run,3
"This app is pretty cool, real time poice radio. Its always fun to listen to how crazy Chicago is and listen to the cop humor!",5
I gave it a 2  star because it not much use for me . I can't get any stations around my area. Not very interesting.,2
"I have not had a reason to use it!!,, , , , , ,m m m m m m m",2
"So much better then buying a scanner! When we get storms here I turn it on, and listen to see what is going out out there, its really nice!",5
I absolutely love this app.  It works amazingly well no matter where we are from West to East coast.  It is informative and helpful.  One of the best apps I have gotten.,5
"I have been using this for several years now, and it has been and continues to be an important tool. I am able to monitor the local Police and Fire activity in my area, and across the Country. Depending on your location, you can even listen to broadcasts from other Countries.",5
We sat here in the living room listening to this one day and it was a nice change from the tv.  Maybe it is just being nosy about our community but it was still fun to listen to all the police reports plus my fiance' is a retired firefighter so he liked listening to it like he did when he was at the firehouse.,5
I cannot access it...,2
this is a cool app it really works and is fun to listen to when you're bored. check it out.,5
"I've always thought it would be neat to listen to a police scanner, but never have till now. ThisScanner works great on my Kindle Fire HD. It was so easy to setup.",5
Its always fun and interesting to listen to police calls. I like this app and you get lots of stations too.,4
cities all across us not just local..so much fun to listen to all the non-sense all over this great country! thanks for hours of entertainment at parties.,5
it was fun to check around home and aslotosee whats hapening around other states. get it to get news 1st or to kill time !!,5
"I enjoy listning to police/fire/rescue frequencies from time to time but don't care to shell out for an actual factual scanner . Thought this would be an enjoyable option , which it was but alas my immediate region is not available to listen in on and lets face it , who wants to NOT hear whats going on in their neck of the woods ? I did enjoy listening in on some of the international frequencies it offered , Sydney Australia is a great one ! So for that alone it was worth it but don't be surprised if your preffered area isn't available since many of the places across the US weren't offered for listening .",3
"Non-intrusive ads, wide selection of radio stations, even a 10-code reference guide!Only thing: Only works while the Kindle is awake. Turns off when Kindle is put into sleep mode.Also, the only advertisement I get personally is for Lookout, which isn't available on Kindle Fire.Still, entirely worthy of five stars!",5
i use this app at least 2times a week. has a nice lay out and is easy to use!!... i have had it since February....nice when stuck in traffic!!,5
I like it but could u put Claiborne county Tennessee and Knox county  Tennessee too other than that have u ever heard a chase before,4
"I was banned for using a word found in the bible, and the next day in the Boston chat room for calling someone a racist after they said they hoped the bombers are white guys. The help page uses an inapropriate vulgar word as an example of what not to say.",1
"There are massive lists of police departments everywhere and I found it overwhelming to try and find the one that I wanted.  It would be better to have significantly betty organization, although the concept is interesting.",4
I recommend getting this app.its really loud but just turn down the volume other than that this app is the best!Download It!!!!!!! :D,5
App doesn't have necessary format to detect local broadcast. Do not recommend particularly in this area. but for free all your out is time trying to use.,1
"I don't have this installed on my smartphone all the time but have downloaded the app when I needed it. In my home area we've had several major fires this summer, and it's helpful to know what's going on in real time. On a trip, we picked up info about a fire in the Sierras near where we were heading. Recommend getting this app for that time you really really need to know about an emergency situation near you.",5
I got. my kindle fire for. Christmas. this. year. this was one of the first. apps. I downloaded and omg love it!!!!!!!!!  thanks amazon!!!!!,4
"It works, it's great to listen to big cities scanner. The only downfall for me personally is there is no scanners in my direct area I can listen to. I do still turn it on from time to time for entertainment/background noise but woudl definitely be more fun if local scanners were included in it. I've had it for quite awhile too and none in my area have been added to the app. It does have a search bar and you can search for any department/area/city....I'd recommend it, just not if you're looking for your city and if you live in the middle of no where!",3
I get more different areas to listen to with this scanner excellent glad I could download this on my kindle fire.,5
This App is almost priceless for the scanner community. With almost all major city going to Digital Trunk since9/11 this app will save you between $350-500. As long as you have High-Speed interenet your all set. The only draw-back is if your in an area with no High-Speed internet capability. Which for most people doesn't apply. I'd highly recommend this App.,5
"I have found that Scanner Radio is the only high quality scanner that works across all operating systems I use. From Windows 7, to Kindle Fire's Android, to my iPhone 5, this is the best app.",5
I don't have this app on my phone anymore not sure how well it worked so 2 stars .  .  .  .  .,2
Was expecting something more like one you'd buy at the store think I was expecting to much for free it may work for others but not for me try it for yourself and see how it works out in your area good luck also don't like the idea of being told how many words I have to use in my review of any item,1
"I was so excited to try this out but the only way I could have access to what I wanted, I found I had to pay. So much for free.",1
when I first downloaded this app I thought I would be listening to MUSIC from detreoit. well I was wrong. it is kind of cool listening to the police talking but it is just weird,3
okay app for my kindle fire it is something to listnein to and different. for my kindle fire and find it interesting,3
I have it on my new kindle fire hd and it works great.I do think any one thats likes scanners should try it.,5
Very good app.beats my police scanner away.sound is lean not the noise like the old scanners use to make.It works very well with my kindle fire.easy to use.,5
I love this app. I don't necessarily use it everyday but this is one app that is not just fun or amusing but may actually help you out and keep you informed. The quality of sound is so much better than screwing with an antennae and trying to adjust as you go.,5
I enjoy using this app.  Lots of good listening available.,4
I live in a small town and have no problem picking up my area police and fire. very happy with this app,5
"Love this app and that it works using Radio Reference, which is where I listen to the scanner on the laptop. Works great! And it's user friendly!",5
"You get one side of most conversations. Plus the authorities all know people listen to these, so, any stuff you shouldn't hear is done sometimes with their cell phones.",3
This is one of the best free scanner apps I'veused and this one has won first place on my tablet's home screen.using this app on my Double Power brand MD-740 tablet.,4
I was worried it wouldn't work on my kindle fire. but it works perfect!!! I recommend downloading. its fun to listen on it :D,5
Not bad if you live in a big city . I have to listen to county not city. No like the old scanners they use to have.,4
"I wanted an ap like this to listen to when I don't have access to my scanner, but this won't work because it doesn't offer any of the frequencies that I like to monitor. I only offers a selective group of frequencies, and they are not in my city! It's OK for what it is, and might be fun to listen to is you want to learn some of the radio codes used by law enforcement, but it doesnt replace a real scanner that can be programmed to your liking.",3
"Very garbeled voice.  I Cannot understand what they are saying most of the time.  However, it is very people friendly whenntrying to find stations.",3
"But I honestly rarely use it.  Just another one of those that sounds neat... and it is, but I just rarely sit down and listen to it.  If you have the time, then get it.  But be realistic.  Do you think you'll actually listen to it past the first day?",4
"I just wanted to see how it worked. My husband use to have a regular scanner that you sit on a table and it reminds me of that, sort of. This was cool because I listened to two guys talk in another totally different state, can't remember which. They were having a whole conversation! :)",5
"Can;t get into it, it has a lot of features and you can pick up any city's scanner, but it is boring.",2
Fans and other assorted and weirdo addicts of Scanner-life in the midnight hour will love this as much as I.do. We are strange and thankfully there are products for our bizarre and idiosyncratic pleasures.,5
I am amazed at the number of different agency's covered and in bad weather the NOAA Weather  Radio is very useful,4
"I have this on my iPhone &amp; it works even better on the Fire! The sound quality is great compared to the phone vs the tablet!  The only thing I see missing are the code explanations that are in the phone app..other than that, this is one cool app to have!!",5
great app.  saves you hundreds because you do not have to purchase a trunking scanner.  I am able to listen to all my local stuff,5
works great. never crashes. got the paid app so I could get the widget.only thing I would like to see would be more color choices for widget....,5
"I am a weather head and like to check scanners where there has been a major weather related event.  This app is working just right for that.  I don't monitor local scanners for all police and emergency activity on a regular basis so I can't speak to that but I think it would be quite suitable.  Update - due to a large event in my area last weekend, I used the local scanner feeds and it was excellent - easy to locate what I wanted and switch between the main police and EMS feeds!  Audio was great, taking into account that scanner audio can be difficult.  Handy pop up of codes, too.",5
"I LOVE this app! I am a firefighter/paramedic and when I am on my way to work, I turn it on to see if the station I am going to is on a call or not....sometimes I listen to it on my days off. There are dozens and dozens of cities on this app!",5
"Works well for my local police, fire, and EMT channels. Not something I will use a lot, but entertaining when I do.",5
I down loaded this and waited and waited for it to come up with something.  I know things were going on as my husband has a scanner in the garage.  I got &#34;nothing&#34;!  Will probably take off my Kindle HD Fire.,2
"I'm sort of leary of downloading anything on my new KF, but this app is fantastic, works great!  Anyone interested in Fire/Police/EMS,it's a must. I'm happy.",5
This is the perfect app if you're nosey and want to hear what the agencies are doing. Catches just about all scanner frequencies.,5
no complaints....does exactly what its supposed to without obnoxious ads. best if used while plugged into your charger.already recommended to two people,5
This is a good app. I can listen to the Police stations in my home town of NY from Texas,4
"This app DOES work; at least it did for me. The problem was where I live, there was so little radio traffic, it was excruciatingly boring. But you may have better luck if you live in a metro area.",4
"I love this app! I only wish I could pick up Las Vegas Metro but there is no option for it. I can get Las Vegas rural NHP with no problem. Having left Vegas for the east coast, I would love to be able to listen in on what's going on in my old neck of the woods...lol",5
"I love this scanner, I listen to it on weekend nights when I want to know what is going on in my neighborhood.",5
"It's fun to listen to police, airport control, etc.Voice quality is too bad to understand anything. PilotsEye.tv (non-free) recordings provide much better voice quality for airport control.",2
"This scanner picks up local frequencies great. Won't work in a power outage, obviously. If you like to hear local 'happenings', this is a good program for your device.",3
Enjoy the app,4
"works really great. only had a problem when it was updated, but they fixed it right away.just love it!very user friendly.",5
"I have a Kindle, but installed this on my android tablet and phone as well. I needed a pdf reader for various work documents, and thought having only one app would just be convenient.  As a reader, yes it performs perfectly. However,  being that there is no print option and I do need that, I've had to download another app. Not a total buzz kill,  but it does limit the Kindle apps usefulness for me.",4
"I have got this on my both iPad2 and Galaxy Siii. I am glad that I got it because now I can buy and read all kinds of books and not needed to have just kindle tablet. Thanks,",5
"Yeah yeah, it's great to have a kindle reader app on your phone.Nothing else about it is good. It crashes constantly, even when I am not using it.Not only is the instability pathetic, but that is exacerbated by the fact that there is no option to tell this dumb thing I don't want it to constantly run (and crash, apparently) in the background. How hard would it be to have an option for that?It makes no effort to keep track of your actual reading progress.  It remembers the last page viewed, which is insufficient because jumping to the index or end notes to check something results in the Kindle app assuming that to be your new current reading progress. Unless you manually bookmarked the page every time, progress is lost. It would be incredibly simple to have a default bookmark which keeps track of the highest page you actually flipped to in 1-page increments, rather than merely the last page displayed.It does let you change the text size and background color, which is worth a couple stars.",2
"The only reason I am not giving this app 5 stars is due more to my phone than to the software itself. My 3.7 inch screen is not the best way to read a book. I very much prefer my real Kindle for that, but but this app works in a pinch.",4
I love this app. It turns you android smart phone into a kindle reader. I also love all the free books I can get through Amazon. I haven't been to the library in months!!,5
"I love the Kindle app, for it's simplicity, and user friendlyness. And the free book downloads that Amazon offers are abundant. I never tire of using it, and I have installed it on all my tablets and PC's A must have for tablet enthusiasts'.",5
"I love reading on my kindle but when I don't have it with me this app comes in pretty handy!  I can import my books from my library and download them to take with me on my phone.  Works great, and I would definitely recommend it!",5
I am so  glad that I down loaded this app to my cell phone; it's a joy to use and I'm glad I got it.,5
I Love to read and this is great because I can download the book I want and don't have all the clutter of  all the books I have read stacked up everywhere.I usually give them away. this way I can erase them or keep them on my sd card.,5
"This app is great if you can't afford a kindle or don't like to lug yours around everyday! I really enjoy this app, I like being able to read my books even if I just get stuck somewhere and don't have my Kindle with me. It works the same syncs very fast.",5
I love to read and this little app is great. Thw bonus is that the bestselling list has 100 free books that change hourly and some books are as low as 99cents.I hardly ever buy a book due to all the free books available on amazon.i read on my optimus m and the kids enjoy childrens books with.pictures on the pc and laptop,5
This app works just fine. First you download it into your Android and then whatever books you wish. Thousands to buy or for free. It will place a Icon Android for Kindle into your tablet. After you sign into it using your Amazon sign in it is just one click after that to get into and read a book.,5
"Works great. I have a Kindle Fire and an Android, I put the Kindle fire app on my android and now I have another mobile device for my e-books.",5
This is among the best ebook readers around for any android tablet.  The interface with Amazon's Kindle system is great,5
Very good app. No need to run in and out of the public library as much anymore. Good amount of free books for my 8 year old to download and read too.,5
"It does the job, sort of.  But for being the only ebook reader app for the most popular source of ebooks--namely, Amazon--it is very sadly lacking in features.  Just compare to ebook readers like Moon+ or Mantano and Android, or even ebook readers on obsolete platforms like Plucker for PalmOS (which I was a developer for).My comments are skewed by the fact that I am a scholar in the humanities, and so my needs are for study rather than just linear reading.Here are some specifics:1. The search is unacceptably slow.  For instance, to search my approximately 6mb ebook, it took six minutes on my Archos 43.  Compare that to 22 seconds with Moon+, or about 50 seconds with Plucker on PalmOS on a much slower device (200MHz versus 1000MHz).  Search is the main advantage of electronic texts for serious students of the texts.  Without a decent speed search, there is little advantage except convenience.  And it would be good to have some more search options (phrase, word, boolean, etc.).2. The subpixel font rendering assumes horizontal RGB striping.  This means that the subpixel algorithm fails, producing faint color shadows near letters, in all orientations other than one (on my Archos 43, it works in portrait, but fails in others;  on my wife's Kindle Fire, it works in landscape, but fails in others).  It's not such a big deal on my Archos 43, as the pixels on it are so small.  This is easy to fix: just turn off subpixel rendering and replace it with grayscale antialiasing, or add an option to do that.  And I bet it works badly in all orientations on OLED devices that don't use uniform RGB stripes at all.  (The best would be to auto-detect based on orientation and screen type.  But I don't know if Android includes an API for getting RGB striping information.  On the Kindle Fire's version of the app, though, you could just go on orientation, since you know which way the RGB is striped there.)  Subpixel rendering for the wrong orientation is worse than grayscale rendering.3. More color options, please.  It would take only a few minutes for the developer to add a bunch more color options.  (I know, because I'm a developer for a PDF viewer for Android.)  For instance, green on black is great for reading at night.  Red on black is essential if you want to preserve night vision.  Black on sepia is nicer than brown on sepia.  And why not just let the user customize it?4. I wish the viewer would optionally let you move through the text by scrolling rather than paging.  Paging isn't quite so good for complex scholarly texts, as it's harder to think about a sentence or paragraph that is broken across screens.  Much easier if you can just scroll it so the text you're thinking about fits on one screen.5. There should be an option to eliminate all margins (on a small screen device, one doesn't need more than about two pixels).  The tightest margin setting still has too much margin.6. Optionally, make the main screen be just a list of titles, like on eink Kindles.  Lists with book cover thumbnails make sense only for small collections of books, and presumably you'd like users to have large connections. :-)7. I can't find a way to categorize books.  There should be one.What do I like?- stability- easy downloads- correct formatting- number of books available",3
"Such great books on here to read, and I don't even read that much, that is until I got this app.",4
"This app is great, I can read all my books and even get all my games for my tablet. It was so easy and no glitches.",5
"I loved this app...until the last update. When opened, the home screen is visable, but frozen. Its completely unresponsive. I will try erasing the app and downloading it again, but I won't allow the update this time. This app quite large, which is rate annoying and seems unnecessary but, in my opinion, worth it if you can get it to work correctly. Using a Samsung Epic Galaxy.",2
was looking forward to using this app from amazon on my poloriod  android tablet but  it wont install plus it took 3 attempts to download ..am very disappointed,1
"I did not want a Kindle...my husband kept trying to get me to read on his...but I like holding the book, turning pages, etc.  I finally grew weary of dragging so many things to church each week, so got it to have my Scriptures on it.  It was so much easier than dragging my large print scriptures everywhere!  Then I went to Italy.  I needed books for the flights, plus my scriptures for daily reading.  I loaded up my Kindle app, and finished the books on the flights that I had received for Christmas...had my daily scripture reading, and added little weight to my luggage and more importantly...took little space in my luggage!  Since my trip, I have continued reading at night in bed with my Kindle app and no longer have to worry about getting up to turn off the light.  The more I use it, the more I like it...and I recently learned that I can &#34;check out&#34; books from the public library, and am no longer limited to the large print section!  Also, my husband and I often like to read a book the other has purchased.  With large numbers, books can be &#34;loaned&#34; to the other.  Wonderful!",5
"i don't have an eReader and may never buy one because i love the feel of books... but since this came free with my phone, i've been using it to finally read those public domain classics. it's nice to have reading material in my pocket everywhere i go. i also occasionally use the aldiko reader, but kindle is my first choice. i also love being able to read this in the dark. great app, lots of free books available for those dipping their toes in waters of eBooks",5
I use this for my android phone and I love it. Yea it is smaller then my actual kindle but it is nice just to be able to pick it up and read,5
"I'm always going somewhere and sometimes sit and wait. Since I can't always take my kindle with me, I always have my phone and it works out great! I can sync all my devices so no matter what I'm reading it on, it will always be on my phone and I never have to worry where I left off since it automatically lets me know what page I was on last no matter what device I was using. LOVE IT!!",5
"I originally had a Sony E-Reader, so Kindle was not an option but now I have a Lenovo K1 Ideapad and the app is available. While the Kindle app does have some good settings like highlighting a word to get the definition, font size and text, easy sync and great night mode. The formatting leaves a lot to be desired. Bundle books become one long book and all the books I have read have yet to have an option of jumping or returning to a page or chapter. Which come to think of it I have not actually read a book with page numbers, just percent of how much of the book has been read. The free books and having them linked to my Amazon account are a plus but the formatting takes this app from great to just okay.",4
i have installed this app two different ways and yet i still can not get it to open!? little help?,1
"I have used this app on both desktop and android and would rate it as &#34;functional, but nothing to write home about. Had to remove it from my phone, but that was because of RAM problems, not the app itself. It does have a few cool &#34;sister&#34; apps that are separate apps working in conjunction w/ it, but the app itself is about what you would expect. May very well work better on the Kindle hardware, but I don't see the point in purchasing a tablet when I have a smart phone, a laptop, and 2 desktops already. I personally prefer Adobe Digital Editions and the Nook apps (Barnes & Noble), but mostly just because I am more familiar, having used them both first, and I actually would rather have a paper book than any of them. If you need a decent reader app, this one is just as good as the next, so go ahead and try it out, just make sure to comparison shop.",3
"The app was extremely easy to find load and now use. I was very worried that I was going to lose all my books in process  of reading. The Kindle DX screen had an unfortunate case non working  mode when the screen went dark with some lines through. Any way I am not able to replace the screen soon and was involved with several books. I remembered that some time ago kindle had an app for pc. I wondered if android was also on their plate . Well after doing a quick search there it was. So now I am able to load  the book in am reafing.forvnow. I am not interested in making my Galaxy Note an e reader, even though the large screen does a great job and it really is a phone. So being old school I prefer to have a separate piece of hardware for the ereader. Ok......I know it's a lame excuse but I really want a Kindle had in color. I really thought the DX would satisfy my cravings for a. Monochrome ereader, but something was missing........oh Yeh COLOR!!!!!So. Here I am typing on my android device. Plugging bit into either a win 7 or vista or Apple  operating systems and wondering when did a phone become a highly sophisticated palm pilot...see in told u I'm old school.  In any case since I forgot what I was reviewing .....oh, the Kindle for Android . Yup great idea and works perfectly...After all I am a man of few words.....lol",5
I have not been able to read a book since the new version loaded on my Android phone.  The books I already had downloaded to my device wouldn't open and neither would new books.  I'm stuck in a cycle of downloading to device and then being told I have to remove them and download them again.  HELP!!!  I see I'm not the only one with this issue.,1
It is easy to use and access to most any book you want. I have used this app for awhile and found it a great resource.,4
"I enjoy reading books and I like to purchase ebooks that won't take up space in my library.  My IPAD is great for reading kindle, but when I don't have Wi-Fi, it is nice to be able to use my phone with the kindle as well.  A great reading app.",5
"3 days ago, every single one of my books became blank pages.  I have updated my device software and I have been trying to get help with this for 3 days now.  So far, I have received no help and my pages are still blank",2
Amazon and Kindle both her top rated in my book god bless you all happy new year. YOUall gave a great 2013.,5
"As an e-reader this app is the Cadillac ( not Rolls) of the bunch. Great content, ease of use, etc.BUT it is not a home library substitute. I feel like it was written by a geek who own two books. I have to go into the PC kindle to find a cookbook or a sifi novel or a computer book and then search the title on the tablet to find the book to read.Your programmers need to talk to that librarian that told them to be quiet in the library when they were eight.If I can't find it, I can't read it.Even the new Fire HD doesn't have collections.  WE CAN'T SHELVE OUR BOOK - FIX IT NOW",3
"As someone who used to own a kindle, this app falls far behind my expectations. The ability to read books, change font size, turn pages quickly is fine. It's the organization, or lack there of, that drives me crazy. I have no idea which books I've read, which ones I've not read. I can't put them into folders or categories like I could on my kindle. It would be nice to file books I've finished into a separate folder, or if there was a way to  tell which books I've read or not in the list of books. That's really irritating. My kindle fire it told me which books I've opened, and which ones were new. This app doesn't do that. I read at least 5 books a week and need a way to organize them, this app falls short.",3
"don't have a actual kindle so i love having this on my phone, comes in handy if I'm waiting to pick kids up or at a appointment! for someone whining about 1 click payment info it's just cause of ordering books &amp; yes i got this off market &amp; not Amazon &amp; i still did that.",5
Every reader should have this App.  You can take you books with you anywhere you have your tablet. It puts resources at your fingertips.  Best of all when you need to take a break from work...just read a book of your choice.,5
Finding free and low cost books for adults and kids that are INTERESTING is quick and easy.  The regular prices are low too.,5
Great app. Was really shocked to see it with 3 1/2 stars. Now if I can find more time to read I would. Doesn't drain phone. Never errors gallaxy s 2,5
"I absolutely love my Kindle for Android. I never thought that I would get into reading ebooks, but the kindle app makes it easy. I especially like how I can read large PDF files on it as well. I'm still not going to give away my physical book library or stop buying physical books, but now I will be adding many ebooks to my library as well.",5
I can read my books with my phone and I don't have to carry my kindle fire (which is heavy compared to my phone),5
"If you like reading this is a must have to read any books on Kindle, I use a table instead of the phone which is to small",5
I give this a 4 out of 5 because I use it for school all of the time and it works great for that.,4
I have this on two android tablets and it works great to read books downloaded. I once owned a Kindle but this is far better.,4
"I have tried other readers, but none match this one!!  I read most of my books on it and recommend to every one I know!!",5
I have trouble with print.  I have to get large print books at the library and sometimes I have to wait for the book to come back and on my tablet it makes it easier.,5
"I keep updating hoping to find some of what I think is essential for reading an ebook, but Kindle doesn't have what I need yet.I want to be able to choose my own font.  I find it very difficult to read in a serif font, but I can't change it.I want to be able to choose left justification.  If you need a large font full justification leaves too much space between words especially if you read on a small device.I want to be able to choose my font size.  The difference in sizes really jumps too much.  If I could choose the font size by number it would really help.Without even these basics, I don't find it very useful.",1
"I love my Kindle and my Android.  When my husband is on the android playing the games or checking out the apps, , I'm on my Kindle  reading.  Love this app thank you",5
I love my Kindle for android. I browse and buy books and always have my books at hand which enables me to read for leisure AND learn  in my &#34; spare&#34; time...no matter how spare.,5
I love the app because it lets me read the books that I have got on my Kindle fire in larger print and enjoy them.,5
I love the ease of being able to download a book from my cloud and pick up where I left off.  It is great for the times I wasn't expecting some down time.  I wish it loaded faster but maybe that is my phone and not the app.,4
"I love this app.  I have it on my phone (note2), tablet and computer.  I liked the previous version before the update also.  The only thing I wish it would do is let me put books in folder under author or read ect. I have a lot of books and sometimes end up re trying to download the same one.",5
"I love this app, to be able to have a kindle without acctually having a kindle. You know, downloaded on to my Android for free. Couldn't get any better than that",5
I love this program.....I am an avid reader and enjoy the ability to have books at my finger tips.  You never know when you will have a chance to read while on the go.,5
Imagine how wonderful it is to carry your Kindle books with you on every device you own. This is reading Heaven!,5
"I'm a huge fan of paper books. I never thought I would like this product, but I'm totally hooked. I still love physical books, but the number of free books available makes this like my own personal public library. I have purchased books, been introduced to many new authors and genres, Mostly I love the free books though.",5
"Impossible to get help, would not work on brand new Zeki again absolutely no help but I think that is by design",1
I reallly like the Kindle for Android.  Now I can read my book anywhere I can use my phone.  Great for those times when you can only read a few pages and dont have your Kindle with you.,5
"I really like that I can have books on my phone that I can read anywhere I have a few minutes. The app remembers where you leave off without having to save it manually. Lots of options like word size, brightness and background color. Very handy being tied to my Amazon account. Love it!",5
"I really love this app. I purchased a polaroid android tablet . There was no reader installed. There were so many to choose from, I didn't have a clue where to start. Now, I'm no geek, so it had to be easy. I figured I'd try the android Kindle because it came standard in so many e-readers it would likely be easy to figure out. Turns out--I was right. I love it. It's so easy to operate my kids can do it. Even I can do it. Bookmark my page and pick up where I left off with no hassle. Now I can use my tablet for what I bought it for--a portable library. It's so easy to go to amazon, find my book, download it and read. The selection is great, and the prices are way better than say-- driving to a big bookseller to search for and buy a paper ( save the trees) book.",5
I recently got this for my new smartphone and it works great.  It picks up right where I left off on my Kindle tablet.  I haven't had any issues with it.  It's a must-have app for people who do a lot of reading.,5
"Ir works well and I appreciate having my favorite books available at hand. I had uninstalled it, as I was hoping it would restoreanother app I had, but it hasn't. I might as well have my app for books then!",5
I think this app is great.  It's easy to use when I don't have my Kindle with me.  It's very distinctive and easy to find.  I've already put it on a friend of mine's new tablet.,5
It works like a charm!  You should try it with your android device.  I found loads of apps that are FREE!,5
It works well for reading on my Pandigital Supernova 2.3.  It is slow to load when I start up and difficult to &#34;Manage my Kindle&#34; with. I handle  most of my kindle managing on my Deck top.,3
"I usually use this app every day...whenever I have downtime. But it just stopped working. Won't stay open, won't sync, won't let me buy new books. Please fix it!",1
Just started reading books with the Kindle.  this was a whole new concept for me.  Like it much better than a real paperback,5
"Kindle broke the mold for e-readers when it hit the market place and still continues, in my opinion, to be the better e-reader.",5
love it. Makes it oh so easy to read my Kindle things on devices other than my Kindle. Indispensable. Definitely worth the download.,5
Love it!,5
"My first read using this app. I like to set the font to white on black, at night I set the  brightness low to read in bed and not disturb my dh. If you set it to the least bright setting it goes completely black! Since you can't see, you can't fix it. I had to uninstall to it. So leaaon learned, right? Well it happened again w/o going into settings- I must have hit a shortcut. Needless to say, very irritating.",3
Put this app on my grandsons tablets they got for Christmas they love being able to read on their tablets.,5
Reading a lot more since a always have phone on me. Ultimate timekiller without sucking down data. Use black background for lower battery usage. I love this app.,5
"There are newer versions of the product now available, but old faithful Kindle 1 has functioned well in a household of two parents and two children (no pets) now for a couple of years with the only trouble being the one sole data port, the mini-USB, is either bent or damaged and now requires the power cable to go in held at an angle to properly work.",5
This app is absolutely fabulous. It does exactly what it is designed to do and is very user friendly. It proves very stable and reliable on each of my mobile devices - including my M. XOOM.  The app makes organizing my personal reading library simple and convenient and allows me to access material from virtually any device any where.,5
This app is not as easily navigated as I would have expected it to be. Several times I have discovered that I cannot read what I wanted to because I hadn't downloaded it yet. I am used to my Kindle which has everything on it until I remove it....,3
"This app used to be my favoriteApp. Last update ruined it. Place in books not saved, not able to remove books, if phone call comes in, instead of going back to where you were, you are now returned to a totally different book at a random spot, and books that you have finished, are now marked at only partially read. I'm uninstalling. Which is too bad. I've spent a lot of money in the store in books. They just lost a customer.",2
This is the app that I read my e-books that I get from Amazon and I like it so much that I got rid off the one from Barnes & Noble from my Nook Table that i purchased from Walmart.,5
"This reading app works great even on my generic tablet. Thank you Amazon for making this available for free. I have Nook as well and I think amazon has a bit more of a selection, esp of free books that are not cheezy romance. LOL",5
Totally awesome!  It was easy to download for my EFun NextBook and it works great and can sync what I already have on my laptop.I am very satisfied with it.,5
"Used to I had to cart 5 or 6 books with me on trips and if I really liked them I had to bring them back with me. With this Kindle for Android app I can have as many books as I want, read them all and buy more. I love books, but this is so space friendly! I no longer need to worry about space, weight, or running out of books. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I often find typos; sometimes reversals, or combining groups of words, missing words, but you can still read and understand the stories.",4
"Very useful, the reading app I use most often. i like that I can now get library books from overdrive on kindle also. Controls are much easier than the other reading apps I have used.",5
"Well of course this app is a must have!! I don't have an actual kindle but this is the next best thing! It's free so right not buy. Very user friendly, keeps track of all books, and great customer service just in case anything happens",5
when listening to a book is not an option i read while i'm stuck waiting i like that the fonts can be set to easy reading for me. and you have a choice of one page at at time,5
Works very well in partnership with my kindle when I am out and about and waiting for some reason.  Very easy to access my books and spend my time well.,4
"Amazon Kindle is easy to use, and easy to update. Kindle is a convenient and enjoyable application to read your books with across all platforms: Android devices, laptops,and Android smartphones.",5
this app is a very nice version for ppl who have smartphones but dont have kindles but want to read on their phones in their spare time.,5
I'm so glad there is this app so I can read on my phone when I have a need to do so. I have invested in lots of books for my kindle fire and so I can make better use of those purchases via my phone.,5
"I thought I'd never get used to not having an actual book in my hand, but I have to admit having this app is great.  I can read on my tablet, or phone whenever I want.  It's especially great at night when I can't sleep.  I normally use a flashlight to read by, which annoys my husband. He doesn't even notice the light from my tablet. Great app for the avid book reader!",5
"This hardly ever works.  Hard to find content , sometimes just doesn't work at all, more often it won't log in properly...",1
"I love that I can read any book right on my phone.  I don't have a regular kindle, but I am having no problems reading on my phone.  Most of the time when I want to read, I am not outdoors, but waiting in line somewhere or on break at work.  This helps with the inevitable glare on cell phone screens.  Also, love the ability to change screen brightness and color.  It helps with eye strain.",5
This App is very easy to use.  It allows me to search for extras in Shelfari (which my Kindle Fire doesn't).  The only issue I have with this App AND Kindle Fire is that they don't have the text to voice ability like my original Kindle Keyboard 3G/WiFi.  Either that or I just haven't found the way to do it.,5
"My Kindle is awesome, but hardly fits in my pocket. This app works very well for being able to read a few pages during a few idle moments during the day.",5
"This is a OK app.  I mean it doesn't do that much.  It surely doesn't have all the features a Kindle reader has.  One day they will upgrade it more so it has more features but in reality Amazon wants you to buy a real Kindle, and not use an app.  Well I did and I gave the real Kindle away.  I got a Samsung Note 2 and that is all I need along with this app.  I am not going to run around with several different devices and the Note 2 does everything and does it well.",5
"Maybe most people don't care , but I read reviews.Update ddoesn't allow you to read reviews just shows the average ratings I freaking hate this, have to look for books on the browser now.",1
kindle is the the greatest app that is made for reading books off line and you don't need internetwhere We live there isn't many towers to support fast internet out here.thx so much to the preinstalled app on my tablet and for Amazon for making it possible Thx medicine,5
Makes it easy to access  your Kindle and to use the full benefit for you and your family. You never lose a beat on a good book or learning tools .,5
I am a reader and at anytime I have free time I usually open the app and continue reading a book that I started.,5
"So far, so good, but I have heard users who lose all their ebooks once they're done, or if they don't continue reading them for a couple days. I'll have to add more info, if the system will let me, to tell people if I lost the book or not.",4
"I love using the Kindle App on my Android phone!! I don't always have my Kindle with me, but I always have my phone by my side. So I can read anywhere anytime. I am in heaven.",5
I really Love this ap for my cell. I can easily read any current books I am reading and not have to carry a bigger unit with me always.,5
"This app keeps getting larger but not for the better. Now for some reason when I want to search for books, it wants to use the phones browser. If I use anything other than Chrome, it then doesn't let me buy books. Why not just let me search for books via the app like it used to be?",2
"Love the product. Makes it easy to read books. However, in the less than a year that i have had it, they have made at least 2 product changes to it that involved a whole new learning time and that is quite annoying.",5
I love my Kindle but to have on tablet too is wonderful.  Hope I will be able to dwnld my ebooks from prior orders w/Amazon,5
I press on this app and I get my books so easier. And I can find the app a lot faster with the colors in this. Thank you Amazon.,5
I have a Kindle Fire but this app is nice to have on my Samsung Axiom. If i'm at the Gym I just pull this out and read a bit while doing some cardio.Nice thing is it sync's back and forth between my phone and kindle so I know where I left off on my last book.Apps works flawlessly on my Android  Phone,5
"I can't believe how easy this app is to use on my Transformer Prime. My only issue is I can't create collections so that I can store the books I have read, in a folder, while allowing the ones I haven't read to be out in the open. But other than that, I have no complaints.edited to add:  I have found that I can delete the books off of my tablet and they remain in my Kindle acct @Amazon.  So while I still can't put them in collections, I can remove them without losing them forever.This app would be also be better if the sorter worked better. I find that some of my books appear under the ""Most Recent"" not in the order that I bought them. This creates an issue with me as I have a lot of books downloaded and would like to read the oldest ones first. Sometimes the newest ones I bought down at the bottom where the oldest ones are located. I also notices that if I update the books because of the author correcting errors, that the book then appears at the top where my newest books are located. The original buy date should be used for sorting by most recent.",5
"How can you not like it?  It brings you Kindle books to your android tablet or phone seamlessly and smoothly.  I've had this app since before I bought my first Kindle (I now have 3 different ones).  No hassle purchases for your books and a huge selection.  Many, many free books, as well.  Thank you again, Amazon.",5
"I like this app; they only problem I have found is that many books are being digitally scanned and sometimes the scanner doesn't read the printed words or symbols well.  Some of the words may be boggled, for instance, or symbols just appear as gobbled and garbled.I sure hope they get that problem cleared up soon.",4
"If for some reason I do not have my kindle with me, I love knowing that my books are still a few clicks away using my Kindle application on my smart phone or tablet! My Kindle will ALWAYS be my favorite  but it's nice to know not all is lost if I forget it!!",5
"Works great on my tablet, but not on my phone. Had to go back to the old version.Try bit.ly/kindlefix",4
"I used to like Kindle. The app was fast and reliable, and made it easy to read an ebook from Amazon on my Nook Color (with N2A).Then I bought a couple of new Kindle books, and Kindle (the app) would not download them unless I updated the app. The new app starts with a gray sphere and freezes there for a long time. Then it loads, and the default screen is not my library but the Kindle store with recommendations. A few buttons later I finally get to select my book and read it. Meanwhile, the app still doesn't allow you to group the books by topic.This spells the end of Kindle for me. I'll move my books over to Calibre, which doesn't try to sell anything and does allow for sorting books.",2
This app is a blessing because I do a lot of reading electronically on my PC Tablet as well as I'm doing research for a paper.,5
I use this app all the time. I have always loved reading and it is nice to know that if I finish a book while I am out I can just pick a new one. A must for readers.,5
"It's an eReader app for books you've bought from Amazon, which I'm. sure you already know. For that purpose it works. It could definitely be better though.Amazon needs to sync personal documents as well as purchased books. If this is a mobile platform for my books why can't all my books come over? Some may point out that personal documents have delivery fees, but that is only using Amazon's 3G and this app uses our networks. Also, why not let us target our app instead of or along with our Kindle? This would require us to be given a unique @Kindle.com email address, but it could work.I also want the app to sync highlighted notes / clippings from when I read on my Kindle.Finally, I want to be able to highlight and share quotes from my clippings like on my Kindle.This app works, but not better than Aldiko and definitely not better than a real Kindle.",3
"This little app turns your Android color tablet &#34;Kindle Fire-Like&#34; only better (IMHO), cause you still have full Android capabilities along with the ability to acquire e-books from Amazon .. I say this a little tongue in cheek cause I understand that the new Fire line is much more friendly and Android-y ..Amazon is a wealth of reading materials, much of it no-cost. You won't be disappointed at all, give it a try!!!",5
"I can read my books wherever I can get WIFI.  I almost always have my Kindle, am at a computer, or have my tablet.  This has made my reading more portable and because it is on my android, I can read in the dark.",5
i dont know how you can have any kindle product without this. i would def recomm to all. what can i say,5
"Clear and convenient, but not as comfortable, manageable or satisfying as I'd hoped.I'm a book lover, and find the tech version of publications rather like the CD was to the LP.Advantages are too dehumanizing for my taste.",3
There is no app I use more than the Kindle app. After the recent app update this app is now even better.The recently read books now show up on the home page along with book recommendations from the kindle store. Great app and its FREE!,5
"I needed something with 2 cameras along with a reader. I liked the size of the Kindle; it is easier to use than a tablet, but the tablet has a front and back camera.",1
I love this app because I LOVE reading!!!  It is very easy to read books with this app.  The only problem I have with it is a lot of times it will not load on my android phone but I don't know if that is my phone or the app's fault.  It doesn't happen with anything else though.,5
"I didn't expect much and was very pleased with this. Many free books by big-name authors available,  with as many as 75 new ones a day (some days 0, 1, 2 etc.) sometimes there is plenty to read,  free or to buy at good prices. Works well, although mine on a DROIDX run sometimes shuts down for no apparent reason. Only capable of using kindle files. Overall, probably my most used program. NOT AS GOOD AS AN ACTUAL KINDLE ! YOU CAN'T DO VIDEO BOOKS, ETC. Limitations. They won't make it much better as they want you to buy a kindle.",5
"Happy, BUT ...Pro:- Can use phone as Kindle-reader, enlargingas needed.- Don't need Internet connection to read- Can go directly to Kindle Store (See Con section)- Other ""pros"" - but those are main ones. Most pros are advantages of any Kindle, with smaller form-factor.Con:- Most cons are about poor UI.- Too difficult to take desired actions after reading a sample- Kindle Store and Amazon.com are SO unrelated, one wonders:(1) Was there ANY Systems Integration in programming process?(2) Does ANYONE in Marketing or Sales want to make it easy (maybe user-friendly) for us to purchase content (that we have decided we want)? Or to let our WishLists know what we WANT?- should integrate WELL with both Amazon mobile apps & with full web-site.- ""Don't judge book by it's cover?"" Bad enough that e-readers lose the sensory aspects of reading - but the lag-time (till next download or more) to SEE the cover? If we can't have ""feel"" of a book, would be nice to have more of the ""look""- Many features not available. Example: During past year, Many Kindle-benefits are advantages of Amazon Prime Membership. BUT, these features are not compatible w this app.With all these cons, and I could list more, why am I giving 3 stars, instead of 1-2? I don't own a Kindle - nor, would I always carry it. So, this app lets me read content anywhere, from phone.",3
"love it. I'm on my 4th book so far.  I would still like to get a kindle someday for the large screen that's easy to read, but this is a GREAT stop gap solution and WAY more portable.  Also, I always have it with me so when I have some unexpected extra time, I'm ready to roll...errr read.",5
"I enjoy reading and this app gives me great options.  Also, the books are reasonable.  I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a Kindle but wants easy access to books.",5
"Well, I just stepped up to a &#34;Smart Phone&#34; and I really like Amazon Kindle for Android.  I also have a Kindle Fire and I really like everything Amazon has to offer.  They are a GREAT COMPANY!!",5
Don't have a Kindle but love reading Jean Auel's Earth's Children on my Vibrant before bed time.  Must have app.,5
"Kindle is probably the best book app I've seen. I bought a couple of my smaller textbooks on my phone, plus you can also view books you've bought with your account on your other devices.",5
"This update is horrible.  Every time I come into the kindle app it tells me my account cannot be synced so I have to uninstall and reinstall the app every time. I need kindle for books I have for some of my classes, and between the syncing issues and the storage amount (whats with that!?) This app is definetly worse now that the update has come.",1
"Will NOT launch AT ALL unless wifi connection is available. Had the app for about a month now. I can disable wifi (to save battery usage) after launching, but operation is significantly slower with eBooks already saved on device. The only thing this Kindle app does is download a giant list of arbitrary 'recommended' and 'best seller' cover pics that I have no interest in and cannot disable. All I wanted to do is read books from  a car or a park bench, for which this app is COMPLETELY worthless. Might as well stick to paper books. S#!*EDIT: Installed on an Android 4.0 device, and STILL won't launch, or even connect to kindle store.",1
"This app is very welcome on my tablet . No difficulty in its use. I have a Samsung galaxy note 2, 10&#34;",5
Haven't used it much but I like having a book on my phone for wait times at various places.  Only time will tell if I love it.,4
I love my Kindle.  Now I can read my book anywhere I go without having to worry about making sure my Kindle is always with me.  I love the sync feature so I can stay at my current page between my phone and Kindle.,4
"Not the same as havin a actual kindle, but works great on my HTC ONE Silver Tmobil phone.  I would really want Hdx Fire 7&#34;.",5
Have not actually downloaded any books as of yet but it looks like it may be helpful as it has a good selection.,4
Love being able to pull up a book and read it on my phone when i am away from my tablet or regular Kindle.  Gives me the flexibility to read wherever I am a nice convenience.,5
Haven't used it much other than for a bible I have on it. I take my actual kindle most places with me anyway.,3
I use this on my Android phone for reading stories to my 8 year old daughter.  The one star removed is for taking forever to first load after not using it for a while.  The app is wonderful for reading.  It makes it a pleasure to read with just flicks of the finger.,4
"An excellent reader, great features, especially the archiving feature and is fast and easy to use.  Also has display adjustments that come in handy.  Works perfectly on android 2.2.",5
"There should be support for reading books download from another source, as well as the ability to use a local dictionary (e.g. ColorDict). The ability to add support for lookup in user defined wikis would be great too.Highlighting text spanning more than one page can be difficult or impossible.  Regarding selection of text, is being able to copy a sentence no more than a few times a day such a problem for publishers? This would be useful for quoting books.Otherwise this app is the best reader I've used, though the first point makes it necessary to have another reader installed.",4
This free app lets me use my tablet as a kindle and works without any problems. Very handy. I'd recommend.,5
What can a person say about a Amazon product except its great. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out the &#34;How to's&#34; in the use of this app. I rate this G for everyone,5
"Ya know what would be great? If I could read my Nook books on the Kindle app and my Kindle books on my Nook app withOUT re-buying them. That'd be SPLENDID. Imagine if you went to the library but had to chose a format, and some books were only available in one, and others only in the other and you had to pay to switch... libraries would close quicker than they already are.",3
I tried to download kindle on my Galaxy S4 and it just keeps telling me I need to download the application.  I haven't been able to get it to work.,2
"i like the kindle its just the right size, stores easy, watch netflix, play games, read books, download tools and features",5
"Comics won't open to full zoom so can't read them, pages turn to quick and messed up slightest touch does something almost everytime, no room for errors here.  Not a fan, but try it maybe you'll have better luck.",2
"How about a search feature so you can scan the book for keywords.  Chapter search would be nice too.  Other than that, it's free and easy to use.",3
"Whenever I want to buy a book from Amazon, I use my Kindle app. I now buy all my books that way.  For example, I have been steadily working my way through Ken McClure's medical thrillers at $5 per book (out of print every way but Kindle for his older books).  It has been a great reading experience.  Ironically, I use my Kindle app more than my sister uses her actual Kindle.  I've also read ebooks on Good Reader and iBooks.  I'd say Kindle holds its own with both of those.",5
"Works pretty good, also lets you open up documents that you receive through e-mail, for those of us who have e-mail through our smart phones now a days.",5
Easy to use. Works great on my Coby. Got several books and they all downloaded fine. Glad I got it,5
i originally downloaded this from Android Marketplace. I loved the ease of reading e books with this app so much that I got a Kindle as well for the extra features. It gives me the best of everything. I am never without a book now but have no more piles of books all over. The sync between Android &amp; Kindle works flawlessly for me. Books can be archived online so I can go back &amp; read again. This is great for me because I love series fiction and sometimes forget things before the next book comes out. There is some content you can't get with the app you can with Kindle. I think maybe Amazon wants to keep a few things out of the app so people still buy Kindles. Something else that makes having both worthwhile is that Kindle is totally non glare so you can read outside but not backlit (which is easier on the eyes) while my phone has backlight so I can read in dark/dim light.,5
I have this for my Samsung Galaxy Phone & my Samsung Galaxy tab.  It works just fine for both of them.,5
I have had the kindle app for yrs. Now can't download it from Amazon or play store. Can anyone tell me why? I've been reading a book but now can't find it.EDIT:Right after I wrote this review the app downloaded. Now a happy camper!!!!!,2
"This app came preloaded on my phone and I absolutely love it.  I can download books and take them anywhere.  My favorite feature is being able to change the background colors between white, sepia, and black.  (When the screen is black, the words are white).  Also, any books I purchase for my phone can also be seen on my Kindle and vise versa.",5
This app has great functionality and works as well on the android device as it does on your pc. What a great app.,5
I love reading books. I was unsure about reading digital book because I loved the feel of an actual book. So it took some getting use to on my part.  Now I love it.,5
works great on my phone when I don't have the kindle with me (which is NOT often) but it's nice to have the option.,5
Just what I needed to get access to my books on my tablet and phone.  Now I can read while waiting in line to pas the time.,5
"Originally got this for my knock-off IPad (called YourPad) and it worked fine for a while, then got glitchy and wouldn't open the book.  Tried removing & reinstalling, however that didn't work.  Got out the CHEAPER knock-off (iBridge), installed Kindle for Android and it has worked PERFECTLY ever since (knock on wood).  I love that I can take my current reading material ANYWHERE and read while I'm waiting at the Drs office or whereever.  Not my favorite app, but probably the most used one.",4
I can read now when waiting for anything. I get a lot of free books and have many to choose from.,5
I have tried several time to get this to work and it will not even let me sign in on my phone to see my books,2
"I used to love this app to read my Kindle books on my phone,  As soon as I downloaded the updates the app doesn't work at all, the error message says it failed.  Very disappointed.If you haven't updated the app yet, don't!!",1
"This great app gives me access to all of my Kindle books when I am unexpectedly delayed at an appointment. This installed and runs without issues on my HTC EVO (Android v2.3.3).This has a lot of nice features like full color book covers, able to indicate and jump to the last location read in a book in progress (as long as your Kindle wireless was on), and ability to access the Amazon Kindle Store. It doesn't have the text-to-speech, but that is a minor consideration.I still prefer to read on myKindle, Wi-Fi, 6"" E Ink Pearl Display, but this is great back-up since I almost always have my phone with me.Highly Recommended!CFH",5
This is one of those must have type of apps! This works perfectly on the Droid x. Easily syncs with your kindle. So many free books to choose from puts this far above the Nook.,5
I love Kindles. I own two and have the app on everything else. The app is easy to use. Now they finally put in page numbers so it will be easy to track progress in text books.  Thank You!,5
"I don't own a Kindle, but have been using the Kindle app to read e-books on my cell phone ever since the program was released and absolutely love it. I have since also installed it on my rooted B&N; Nook Color, and enjoy it even more.This is a very convenient way to read since the program offers very stable performance, allows extensive customizations (such as changing font size and screen brightness), and remembers where in the book you last left off. I frequently use this program in the subway, it is great for when you want to relax but you don't have a cell signal to run some other programs.The real benefit of reading through the Kindle app as opposed to some alternatives is that the checkout process is lightning-fast. You can also frequently get free books for Kindle, so not only am I able to read more conveniently, but more cheaply, too!I am currently running it on my Droid 2 Global running Froyo (2.2), and have had no problems. While you can't download onto a tablet or AT&T; phone through the Amazon Appstore yet, you can get this through the Android Market on those devices.",5
"Kindle offers the convenience needed to read book. First of all imagine you had to carry you best 10 books on you or with you everywhere you went.. It would far better having just the words in these books without the paper used to put the ink on it. Kindle makes reading books a comfortable experience and you can then exercise your arm and hand muscles in a gym instead of carrying a heavy book bag. In conclusion, use kindle you stone age mammal. What did you think the year was, 0214 AD? It's 14 years after two millenniums. Stop encouraging the cutting of more trees. Try Kindle!",5
The features of this app are awesome. I love the fact that you can lock the vertical view. I read much at night and i hated when the screen would flip sideways while I laid down.,5
"Downloaded this app, great books for free! Thousands of classical books to be read.  I love this app! Get this app if you haven't yet!",5
"I thought this was something different than what I had, before I realized I already had this on my phone. If you like to read this might be for you.",3
I use this app everyday.  I have it on 3 different tablets.  One has android 2.1 and is basically only a back up now.  The other two Samsung Galaxy Tab 7. 2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 both have this app installed.  I read from whichever one is appropriate at the time.  I both buy books and get library books on this app and it works terrifically.  Get it you'll use it.  It's easy,5
Well don't really need a kindle as this app works nicely on my android tablet. A very much needed app on the tablet.,5
"I like the functionality generally; I haven't got any complaints but haven't used it much.One thing I DO want though:  I would like for updating this app via Android Market to NOT make it show as needing update on Amazon Market, and vice versa. Same problem with Amazon Mp3 app.",3
"a very good reader for books, pdf and doc files i have found as well. simple and easy to use. one of the best i have found so far.  if you read and do any sort of documents and files, i would highly suggest you consider this if using a kindle fire or an android tablet.",5
"Before I had a kindle I tried the kindle app on my Droid X2 and took to it like a fish to water. I find the android version especially good for reading in bed with the lights out. Like when your better half is sleeping. I switch the text to white, background to black, and the brightness on the lowest setting and all is good. The potential detraction of the small screen is well made up for by the light weight & ease of handling with the phone. I can easily one-hand it and switch positions without much fuss. With a little practice, I can even change pages with one hand, swiping with my thumb. I've also found this app convenient for waiting room time at doctors & dentist appointments.With the addition of whispersynch, I can switch between my kindle and android phone with ease. Each time, the current device offers to take me right to where I was reading on the other device and with a click, I'm right where I left off.  Heh, I can imagine a decade from now explaining to the youngsters about the days before whispersynch, much to their disbelief and bemusement. Cheers.",5
"Its it's a good application that allows me to download my texts to my laptop. Being a student, it helps a lot.",5
I love the new Kindle Fire. The quality of the display graphics is amazing. It is fairly easy to learn the different features and is pretty intuitive. My Kindle has both WiFi and a connection to work off a cell signal. I wish the basic instructions for setting up the cell connection had been included with the Kindle. I did get help from Amazon but it was a little frustrating.,5
"While I can still see more on a big screen, the Android app has a feature I've been hoping for forever and it's not on the computer app.  It tells me how much I have to read in a chapter.When I'm reading, after I finish a chapter, I'd like to know how long the next chapter is so I can decide whether to read it or put it down. Easy in a book. Impossible on the Kindle without messing up my forward progress.Now it tells me how much is left in the chapter at the bottom of each page.It says it in minutes rather than pages. I'm not sure why. Pages make more sense, but it say it, and that works beautifully.",5
Wow!!  Kindle is absultly amazing!!!I keep telling all my friends who don't have kindle that it truly isA MUST HAVE!! Love the choices of books and how organised the sppIs. The library & I can even share my books with other kindle useres.It is the BEST app I have ever had!! Words can not describe how cool kindleIs.  Thank you so very much kindle!!!,5
"I was informed it's for PCs and other devices such as phones, and I didn't need this option. So this review is neutral, and maybe useful with those uses in the future, if I ever need it.",3
"I cant read a novel on my phone because the screen is just too small to stare at for hours at a time. This is a great application however, when I am reading a book I just read it on my kindle because the screen is larger.",4
"I'm the kind that seems to buy the latest version of the kindle so I've gone through lots of different kindles and having lots of android devices and cloud accounts to make sure no matter where I am I can always access my content as Amazon states.  Buy once and read on all your devices is misleading.  I just bought a new phone and can't put half my books on it because it says I ran out of licenses for that book so they want me to buy them again or get rid of some of my devices!  Sounds like false advertising!  I am one that HATES to read but LOVE my kindle (no kidding!), I've read more books since I got my kindle than I have in 20 years because I really like the kindle but now I'm getting where I can't even put all my content on my devices out of fear of losing access to them all if I keep upgrading so be careful with adding lots of kindle software to all your devices as you just might run out of access to your library.  By the way, I'm the only one with access to my devices as I have to family to share them with, so there will never be 2 devices reading anything at the same time.....just me with lots of gadgets and now I can't even put my library on all my devices....5 stars if advertising was correct.....BUY ONCE, READ EVERYWHERE?????  More like buy once, read on first few devices you install it on and don't upgrade either or you can lose access to your library.....Either way I still like my kindle keyboards that have all my books on them although I'm afraid to upgrade them now.......Danny",3
"its great to use since i dont have a stand alone kindle yet...and cant beat the price...free....only have 7 books along with it, but how many books can you read at once",5
I purchased the Fire mostly for reading and am impressed by the number of books available for very little cost.,4
Kindle for Android is quite simply the  best book store and reading app available.  Is there a tablet owner alive who hasn't installed this priceless app?  Smooth as butter!!!!,5
I don't have a Kindle. I have only used this app. It is easy to use and read. Easy to buy new books. There is a better app for public domain books since those seem to be generally poorly formatted from the Kindle store.,4
"Yet another mystery as to what happened to it. Oh well, I can live without it. No experience to share. Maybe it's in the mail.",1
"I love Kindle! Wherever I am, I have my whole library with me on my phone, my tablet, Kindle Fire, or pc. I thought I would miss having &#34;real&#34; books but the advantages far outweigh that loss. It's easier to hold, especially when reading in bed. I can change the page colors, letter size and spacing to avoid eye fatigue. No more lost books, bookmarks or places. I'm able to instantly look up an unfamiliar word rather than guessing at the meaning. Seriously, do you keep reading or run to find a dictionary when you come across one of &#34;those&#34; words? I'm able to easily highlight passages I want to remember. I can shop for a favorite/new book any time, anywhere. I don't have to buy more bookcases or find places for my books. It's simple (and free) to find and read those classics I always told myself I would read &#34;someday&#34;. Kindle even has sales on books. I have discovered new favorite authors by taking advantage of the countless free books offered daily. My grandchildren know Grandma always has a new book to read to them. I still love bookstores, but Kindle gives me so much more to choose from and this store is always open!",5
"This app was already on my android device before I bought it. (verizon shovelware) It&apos;s nice if you like electronic books and the ability of Amazon to suddenly say this book is no longer available for liscensing reasons and it suddenly disappear from your device.  Other than that a good ebook reader, even if it is heavily DRMed.",5
"Why on Earth did Amazon have to change the app?  By far, my most used App, Kindle for Android was as easy to use as the Kindle.  Now, I have to select the home tab to get to my books.  When I open the app, I'm opening to read. . .  not have suggestions shoved down my throat.  Amazon, you already have my business; please let me have my Kindle for Android app back.  Or, could you at least give me the option to not have selections glaring at me when I open the app?This was a 5 star app until the most recent update.  I understand that most people probably like the changes but how about considering those of us who don't?",4
I like the convince of finishing one book in a series and within seconds having the next one delivered to my device.I can even read on my phone during those times I am waiting with nothing else to do.I enjoy the app very much.,5
I downed the latest version of Kindle on my Notes II.  I cannot open the books I downloaded for Kindle (from Amazon).  It tells me to update and I tried and I already got the latest but I still cannot open it.  I downloaded the Kindle app on my IPad and it opened my books fine.  Kindle app dev team needs to focus on the compatibility issue.,3
Love the app.  My Android tablet is now used even more than my Kindle.  Love to have my books and notes everywhere I go.  Only wish I could copy and paste!,5
"I used to have the Kindle app on my old computer--never had a problem.Now on my new computer, and also on my android phone, I cannot sign into it.  It does not recognize the information when I try to log on (both are correct, I've quadruple checked, and I use them everyday on Amazon.com).  I plan to get an iPad in the near future to replace the Kindle Fire HD (which is as glitchy as can be) and when I do, how will I read my Kindle books if the app acts the same on the iPad?  Guess I'll be getting my books at iTunes, even though I'd rather not.I'm actually a huge fan of Amazon, but recent experiences are souring me, because of their software issues, and a couple of bad calls to customer service.  I miss the Amazon of two years ago.  :-(A Kindle app I can't sign into is pretty much useless.",1
I own a Nexus 7 2013 model and so far the Kindle app works just fine on it. I downloaded the book &#34;My Mac is a drug&#34; by Dave Cryer(fantastic read) and the app performed as it should with no problems at all. Would I recommend this app? Yes I would.,5
It's awesome being able to access my kindle items from any of my android devices! I've enjoyed being able to use this on my phone and laptop :),5
"This rating is for the most recent Kindle for Android updated version 3.3.0.405, which will not install on my Cruz T105 tablet. Please update again soon!  I'd like to keep reading Kindle books on my current android device. :)",2
"Got my first smart phone and now I can wait for the kids at the bus stop and read off my phone, do not have to drag the Kindle around. This is really great and works like a charm.",5
Having the Kindle app on my Droid Global and Kindle Fire means I can read 2 different books or the same one because they sync to where I have read. No book marks falling put of my books or grandkids playing--- doggy bone with my bookmark.  To much fun!!!!  Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"This came preloaded on my new Atrix, which uses Ice Cream Sandwich. It doesn't work. When opened, it looped back to the install screen, then turned into a generic black screen without running at all. It sucks, because I have a large kindle ebook library I can't use on my phone now.",1
"I could not download this for my tablet (Chuwi V99) fromt he google play store, but found it here and it works great.",5
"Sometimes works well but often it will lock up and you have to find your way back  to the page you were reading, which isn't all that easy.",3
Enjoy the fact that I can read anywhere.  Makes it convenient for me to keep up on my Bible reading.,4
"Serves it purpose for when I need it otherwise nothing special about to promote, positive or negative at this time.",3
"All my KIndle Touch books moved to my HP Slate 7 Tablet cleanly, with color.  Many Android aps now available through Amazon. This is an indispensable tool for Android users.",5
I spent four days a trip to ATT store only to find out in the end that it was Amazons screw ups. so finally got it to work after three installs and the help from ATT cust service.thanks folksdray,3
"I have an Acer A100, and this app opens the whole world of Amazon to me. A &#34;Prime&#34; membership even makes it better.",5
"I wanted to read a book excerpt on Kindle, and I don't have an e-reader, so I downloaded it for my Android phone. It worked so smooth and quick, it was great!",4
My husband purchased this kindle for my birthday.  I had previously bought a cheaper tablet that is not as easy to use.  I love my Kindle!,5
"I first downloaded this app on my blackberry, and I have read about 15-20 books from it. It's great, most people take their phone everywhere with them, so if you have a couple of minutes of down time at the doctors office, or waiting for your car to be serviced, this is an awesome app to have. I just downloaded it on my 7"" tablet, and it's even better than before, now with the larger screen size, it's no different than reading a paperback novel that you would buy in the stores now-a-days. You can get quite a few books from the Kindle Book store for the same price as 1 book retail in the stores. They have tons of free books, and alot more pretty cheap.",5
"I love this application. In fact, its my favorite download so far.i found a great book right away and Im into it!The controls and settings are easy to access and it always has my place saved.Its portable and its free, I cant see how it can get much better than that!I cant wait to start my next book on my android! I always have my phone and therefore I always have a book!Thank you Thank You Thank you!highly recommend downloading this and giving it a shot.My favorite thing:Putting my baby down to sleep I have to keep the room silent, and dark. I like to hang around when he goes to bed because hes teething and wakes up in pain fairly often. when I put him to sleep, I roll over and whip out my phone and read a book on my phone until Im tired, its like stealing some adult time and still being an attentive mom!",5
"One of my most used apps, I have this app on all my devices!",5
Installed this on a regular Android tablet and works great.  Would recommend this to anyone wanting books for their tablet.,5
I just started using the Kindle app.  I am still learning to navigate the app.  It has proven great so far.  I am looking for more books and time to read them.,4
"Does what it says, reading a book got a lot easier. No issues downloading it or using it. I can access all of my books that are in my regular Kindle so if I get stuck somewhere and need something to occupy my time, I can read.",5
"Have not had it long enough to give a good evaluation.  Seems to work fine.  Like anything else with apps and electronic devices, you must learn best way to navigate.",4
Such a great app to allow me to carry my Kindle collection on my new smartphone..so I can download my books on a 3g connection when I'm out of range for my Kindle FireLove it.,5
I really love this app.  Great way to read books and save them with out the clutter in the living room.,5
I've only downloaded one book and have not read it yet. Have not used it enough to give it a higher rating.,3
"Works well for smartphones and tablets alike with a great selection of books, many of which are free. To use it you will need an account here with a credit card on file though.",4
"I use this app multiple times a day. I have it on every android device I own. I would recommend this to on the go readers this way you already pack your cell phone or tablet, so no need to pack a book.",5
"I love that I can access my books from my phone. But I'd love it if I could access everything on my Kindle like my pictures & music that I have in the cloud. I have a cloud app on my phone that I wish I could access my music. But overall, I love tjat I can read my books anywhere I go, even if I forget to take my Kindle with me.",4
"I love my kindle more than any other tablet for reading, but I bought a galaxy because the kindle cannot get any apps that are on the google play store.  This app is almost as good as reading on the kindle, but I think the kindle still has more features such as finding the table of contents and searching, but this is a good app because I can read all of my kindle books on my galaxy.",5
"To access your kindle books on an android tablet, this is the best way to do it. It's a little more cumbersome to get your books off the cloud, but once downloaded to your android (Galaxy tablet in my case), this works out just fine. On the Asus and Dell Windows 8.1 tablets (which are actually PCs), it's even more difficult to access the cloud for previously purchased books. I won't take any stars away for that, but only because there may be an easier way and I'm new to Win8 tablets. (Aren't we all?) Considering how many android apps there are, however, I am at a point where I can say that Android is far easier to deal with vis a vis Kindle and apps in general.",4
"I can read any book on the go with my Android Tablet, It's the best on the market, you will like to add Send to Kindle also",5
"If you like to read and have an Android device this is a must have. I own a Kindle, an I-device and an Android tablet. Amazon has never let me down when it comes to e-reading. All of my books easily sync to each device and the eBooks are always sitting quietly in my library patiently waiting their turn to be read.  I love the fact that every single book, no matter what device I read them on, can be read off-line. The number of free and for purchase books is never ending. The Android app. is just as user friendly as an actual Kindle. Step 1: Set up an account. Step 2: Choose a book. Step 3: Read.  Oh, get this...when you call Amazon with a Kindle question - you get a real live person, who actually helps. Get this app!",5
workable very well in my HTC EVO. Lots of free good books and novellas to read. This is a MUST app!,5
"This is the one app that I use daily and has changed the way I read books.  I am the type of person that always has a book nearby and the Kindle app allows me to carry multiple titles in a very small package.  I went to Italy with several books loaded and it was nice to be able to read on the plane, tour bus, etc. without the weight of a book in my hand.  The app is very easy to use and I like the new updates; books are easy to find on the carousel.  This is the first app I loaded when I had to change phones recently... couldn't imagine my phone without it.  Even my 82 y.o. mother has gotten into the swing with her new phone.  She rarely makes calls but loves to have a book close at hand!",5
My wife thoroughly enjoys her Kindle Fire HX.  This app helps her to locate the books she wants to read.,5
"When I rooted my B&N; Nook Color one of the first apps I downloaded was this one. I absolutely love getting books from Amazon!But all is not perfect with this app. Twice I have turned on my Nook only to find out that the reading app has decided to put all my books over into my Archive area. All my books! Each & every one of them! So frustrating! I've contacted support about this twice for no answers. My sister's has done the same thing several times as well.Also I understand that Kindle users have the option of categorizing or organizing their books - wish we with the app could do that too. To mark them as read, unread or make a note regarding the book. Also to be able to leave a review for a book directly from the app as opposed to logging into Amazon to do so.We have no way to remove the books from our device once they are downloaded. They just continue to clutter up the device unless you choose to delete them entirely from your Amazon library. Some books that's ok for but then some books you might want to keep & loan out but not have them remain on your device.I noticed we have not had an update on the app since 2011...please give us categories, a way to mark them, option to remove books from device & leave in our library, a way to leave a review on a book without opening a browser & getting to Amazon and fix the bug that causes the app to move our books to Archive without our permission!",3
Works seamlessly across Kindle and 2 smartphones.  You can choose when it syncs so you don't disturb your place on other devices.  Easily changes viewing options (dark background vs white background) and text size.  A must have for any kindle owner.,5
I don't read much but I am planning to change that. It works for now. I only downloaded one book to see how it works and the kindle for andriod that I downloaded.,4
"We love our Kindles, but having the option to continue reading our current books on other devices is just too cool.  It picks up where you left off as long as the WiFi is on regardless of what device you are on.  We use it on our Kinles of course, our smart phones, and now our ePads.  The vendor of the ePad said Kindle would not work without a difficult download of an older version of the app; then an update by replacing it with a new app.  None of that was required.  I just downloaded the Kindle app for Android and it works right out the shoot.  It even does somethings better than the Kindle itself.  The battery is much better on the Kindle, but having the ePad option just makes it even better.",5
love this app. you can download this on any device and read whatever you have across all your devices. One of the best apps I have.,5
"Just love to be able to have my books available wherever specially last week when i spent 1 week on jury duty.  i had 2 hour lunches and a lot of down time waiting for lawyers to agree on what we could/or could not have presented to us, it was a blessing!",5
"Does what it says, I have a kindle fire and this works as well, although a little different; and they sync",5
"An easy way to take Kindle with you on your smart phone. I use it all the time to read books while in waiting rooms, waiting for others, etc...",5
"Kindle brings convenience to reading.Rather than lug books around, they are available to read whenever and wherever wanted.I haven't taken a trip with it yet but I know I'll be happy with it when I do.Even the cover of the app stands out and signals the entrance to wonderful reading experiences.Thank you.",5
I just updated my Kindle app...it  went from 5mb to almost 20mb. While I am sure there are many differences between 3.2 and 3.5...it still has no page numbers. Kindle for iPod touch and iPhone has page numbers so it's something I have come to expect from Kindle. Add page numbers and it'll be a 5 star app for me.,3
great!!!!!!!!!!!this is all I have to say. I am trying to get back to what I am working on .,4
New for me.. but I love to read and its much easier to carry my kindle fire with me and not worry about the pages getting dog eared,4
"Allows me to enjoy my books on the run. I do not have a kindle, and now I want one. This app is simple. It does not cause my phone to slow down.  I can access all of my books. This works great.",5
It works very well on my android phone. I have the new Samsung Note III and Kindle for android works quite well with it.,5
"When I got the latest update, it slowed my phone down considerably. Now it force closes about every time I use it. I uninstalled it and now the whole phone works much better. I loved the older version much better. I might consider coming back if they would fix the bugs. I love the ability to read my books on my Android. Guess I'll have to go with Google books for now.",2
"I don't have a kindle, but this little app on my LG optimus v lets me read all the freebies from Amazon.  I have no complaints.",4
I have enjoyed being able to get my Kindle on my phone. Play games and read books whereever I go.,4
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Verizon latest build update.First: The support folks are terrific. Not too much to do with the issue.Next. The new interface is awkward to say the least. Have had to use cloud on my Fire to insert titles for purchace. Records show previous purchase. Then download at no additional cost.  Although they still don't show in the cloud when sync is used.Have used Kindle reader on All my devices including this one without issue until this latest build.Would like to see last format returned.Cloud access issue seems fixed. Uninstall update. Reinstall. Cloud now appears. All books on device need be downloaded againd.,3
"I like that I can access my kindle books anywhere, anytime.  It was easy to install, and is easy to use.",5
"I love that I can carry the works of Lovecraft and a couple history books, and more, on my phone.  The app works great for reading.  A phone, even with the bigger screens on new phones, is not perfect, but since you have your phone nearly 24/7, this is a great way to kill any down time you get hit with.The synch feature is great if you have a kindle.  When you load up a document you've also read on the Kindle, it offers to move you to the furthest page you've reached.  This is the one flaw, however.  If you load up the app to check your position and update to where you are on a Kindle, you can't back out of the app without losing your place.  There's no quit option, and the phone's equivalent of escape simply undoes the synch, then lets you quit.  You're required to continue reading, I guess.Still, the app is amazing, free, and is a gateway to a great many books which are also free, in addition to whatever you might buy.EDIT - Touch the text of the book to bring up the various menus and symbols, then hit the Kindle symbol in the upper left to exit the book without losing your place.  Not exactly intuitive, but it works.",4
I love this app because it lets me read at night by using white letters on a black background. No bright light to keep my husband awake.,5
"I installed this on my Android tablet in order to download books available on Amazon. So far, it has twice posted an error saying (something to the effect) that the titles I downloaded were not properly registered and to delete and download them again. They read properly after each new download, but I can't say it won't happen again. Just hope it isn't right after I've boarded a plane.The satisfaction of immediately reading a purchase (after download - I don't do clouds), having a library (which can contain groups) in such a small package, and the typical cost savings between the electronic and the tree editions of a publication are definite pros. Also, the dictionary works well, and I like that books reopen where I left off.On the other hand, I have failed to determine where the downloads are being saved. I want to force them to my external SD card since my internal memory is limited and many applications won't run from anywhere else. I can't find any setting for selecting the download destination, and haven't been able to find the actual files, yet, to see where they've been saved. Even if they are going where I'd like, I consider the inability to specify a location an irritating omission.I would still recommend this product, particularly since it's 1) free, 2) easy to use, and 3) removable.",3
THIS IS ONE OF THREE APPS I AM USING TO READ PDF FILES.  IT IS GOOD AN IT WORKS WELL AS WELL AS PROVIDIN ANOTHER OPTION TO READ ARTICLES WHEN I AM ON THE RAOD.,5
"I like being able to read books on my phone and not have to carry my iPad all the time. I can buy a book on my phone and then transfer it to my iPad---have to download another free ap to the iPad for that. My one complaint is that I can find no way to change the copy to unjustified so you get huge spaces between words on the small screen. Being a graphic designer, that bothers me a lot.",4
"I love using this app. It's become my very own personal best friend in the past months. There are drawbacks I don't like. Number one being that there are no page numbers and sometimes there is no way to navigate chapters. If you lose your place at times you have to flip through and hope to find it again or trial and error. There needs to be a page location that is not just 374 out of 1000, which doesn't reflect the page number. The other thing I don't like is that you can't organize your books. There is no way to make a book playlist by author or by name. I wanted to separate the same author books into the proper series to read by and it won't let me at all, which is frustrating. Other than that though, it is a good app and swiftly allows downloads of new items. Also multiple book bundles get a little wonky when trying to find another book within the bundle to read.",5
"whoo, love the kindle app.  had it installed in my old cheap tablet so i could read my kindle books, also have it on my computer too.  Its really a great app as it allows you to read your kindle books on multiple devices.",4
Kindle for android has come in handy more often than I know. I frequently travel long distances for work. The kindle helps pass the time quickly.,5
"I primarily use it to read library books that have lots of illustrations or links.Pros:--Makes it possible to see pictures that often aren't shown in e-pub versions of books.--Makes it possible to link to outside content.Cons:--Awkward checkout process (have to go to Amazon account to check out, then do a sync to download book)--Awkward return process (have to go to Amazon account to return/delete, slow, then delete from Android separately)--Working with items in Amazon account not excessively easy, often slow.",4
"I'll be able to read on my tablet, as well as on my Kindle.  Works perfectly.  Very happy with product",5
"Downloaded this app and installed it on my Android tablets (Wife and I have 3 of them) and love they way they work, absolutely perfect for reading Kindle formatted ebooks on devices that Aren't Kindle.",5
"I have the Kindle app for all 3 of my Windows computers (I couldn't get the ""insert a product link"" to work so you can get this same app for your windows computer at http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=kcp_pc_ln_ar?docId=1000426311. I have over 50 or so books on it so far and was just a few weeks ago talking to my mom about getting a Kindle. It is convenient for me to have the computer app though as I am a full time student getting a degree in Internet Marketing/New Media online so I spend a great deal of time on my computer. It has become a part of me at this point, I think.But, I also downloaded the Kindle app for my Android phone which I was asked to review. It absolutely makes me so angry I see red and I am a pretty laid back person about technology because when you deal with them all the time; you must learn patience for those days that they have minds of their own.But, seriously, the Kindle app for my Android worked fine for the first 2 books I got. Ever since, it has been a battle between me, the app, and the Amazon site as the app will not sync all of the books I have on all of my other apps. I have done everything I can think of. I have uninstalled it and re-installed it 2 times and still nothing. I find it so frustrating because I really really want it to work. I LOVE the kindle idea. I live in an apartment and do not have a ton of room for hard cover books. Whoever thought up the Kindle idea is brilliant. It is perfect for people now a days who are always on the go; but I BEG of you, Amazon, re-evaluate your Android Kindle App PLEASE!!! PRETTY PLEASE!! It was so great having those first 3 books with me everywhere I went.Thank you for your time and I do hope if you do download the app as I did; you all have better luck.Regards,~ Holley Jacobs",1
This is great for me because I can find books that I couldn't any where else.  I find books for my tablet when I couldn't download it to.,5
Who said you need a Kindle to read? This works well on my Samsung S4. No problems with the download or the use afterwards.,5
"When I first got my Galaxy Note 2 and downloaded this app I just went crazy, reading and reading, dozens of books, quickly. However, of late, I have drifted back to the library.I just like the feel of a real book.Otherwise, highly recommended.",4
"This product works great on an Android tablet, PC, and even a MAC. It fuctions very similar on each of these and I would recommend it to others.",5
"I have a Nabi.Downloaded it to read ebooks.  I was SO excited.  Got going, downloaded samples, got hooked, went to purchase the full book to continue on and.... the books I wanted were suddenly uncompatable with my device.",1
"Kindle for AndroidIf you have a Kindle account and an Android device you need this app. Without it I couldn't read my ebooks on my Android. I have found that in using an Android tablet, in my case it's a Pandigital SuperNova, you should have your Amazon Kindle archive account listed as a favorite in your browser. This way you can go to your book list and simply tell it to download to which device you are using.As with most anything you get or do with Amazon you can't go wrong. It's all good.",5
I am and have never been a reader and my mother is and she so wants me to be badly. Well I got the Kindle app for my android tablet and am now really loving reading first time in my entire life and I am 46 yrs old.,5
"I love the Kindle app.  I've had it on two Android phones (Moment and Evo), an iTouch, and two iPads (1 & 2).  It works perfectly on all of them!!  I've never had it crash.I know this is a review for the Android version, but I only mention my other devices because of the fact that I love how it sync's information between devices.  I did not know this as I had read most of a book on an iTouch and then stopped reading it for a few months.  When I installed it on my Evo I re-downloaded the book thinking I might go ahead and finish it but was concerned that I might not remember where I left off.  but when I opened the book, it took me right to the spot I had left off.I must say, this impresses the living daylights out of me!!  Thank you, Amazon, for adding that as a feature.Otherwise, it does everything you need in a book reader.  You can bookmark, you can change the size of the text, you can even change the coloring (I prefer Sepia when reading during the day and Black when reading at night).  In the Android version you can even ""share"" your progress so you can brag about what you've read to all your friends or those who might be reading with you.  You can even shop for books right inside the app.I love this and it is no wonder that Kindle is such a strong contender in the eReader fields and it is always the first ebook reader I install any time I get a compatible device.  I look forward to what they release in the future as I'm sure it will only get better.",5
"This is a good addition to Overdrive Media,  Between the two of them, I plan on catching up my reading.  When I sign up for Prime, I will get even more out of this app.  I plan on adding Prime in the fall.",5
Wonderful app. Does what it is supposed to do. Very easy to use and it's free. Who dosent like free,5
"Got this program as the free ap of the day, but really didn't use it. I wish the Kindle allowed users to access Google play",1
"NO Password Protection - One Click Always ON!! I email Amazon and they replied ""at this time, the password feature is not available on Kindle app for Android"". That is a terrible way to do business. It is very shady to try to get people to constantly buy things buy accident. They demand card information and then offer no protection once the app is on you phone or tablet. Anyone (including my children just trying to read their chapter book for school) could buy books accidentally. What a shady business strategy! I am VERY disappointed in you Amazon. I expected better from you. This is shameful exploitation of loyal customers.",1
I get good entertainment from the reading app.  it fits my need and can download any kindle edition book.  I have fallen asleep to it more than once.,4
"Although I own a Kindle Paperwhite, I often don't have it with me when I have to wait in a doctor/dentist office or at the car repair place. For those times, I continue my reading on my Android smartphone using the Kindle for Android app. It's saved me from hours of boredom many times. The app doesn't give all the convenience and features that I have on my Kindle, but it's close enough.",5
No way to get kindle format (azw ) for my aoson  keeps crashing  no support to get help for this.. really suck's now I really refuse to buy those kindle books,2
Love the opportunity to read Kindle on my android. Very convenient & easy to use. Basically its the same as having a Kindle. Love it!,4
"It's not always easy to travel with books. The Kindle apps helps me to travel, wait in Dr offices, waiting in line at the grocery store...it's also helping me to get of the clutter by getting all my books moved to ebooks.",5
"Why does Amazon need to know what else I am running on my tablet? Intruisive and spyware. Hasen't Amazon learned anything from the Carrier IQ debacle? This is a shame because prior to this most recent update, this was one of my favorite apps,",1
"Kindle is everywhere. My mom was an early Kindle adopter and this app has worked great for me on several different smart phones and tablets I have aquired and the content is available for any of them. I use other reader apps of course, but this is the primo one.Enjoy.Jb",4
"This is by far my favorite application for e-books.Combine this with the outstanding assortment of books from Amazon and you're on your way to reading heaven. There are frequent, non-obtrusive updates that make this application all the more appealing.",5
Very good app for reading books. Keeps all your books for ever so you can remove them from the device but still have access to them. Plus I can borrow digital books from my library and read hem in this app.,5
"...what really needs to be said??I got this app and put it onto an Archos A70 internet tablet to use the tablet for some reading.  Sure, it's not a real Kindle and the screen glare makes it hard to read in the day time, but that's got nothing to do with the app.The app works great.  Finding books, purchasing them, and reading them are all very easy to accomplish.Good stuff.",5
this app allows me to buy and/or download ebooks from amazon. I am very happy being able to access amazon.,5
"After resisting a full year, I got a kindle as a gift. It took 3 days to warm up to it. It took 2 weeks before I was addicted. After 3 months, my husband threatened to divorce me. I got an android phone. This was my first downloaded app. I thought the kindle was wonderful. This app takes kindle to a whole new level. I won't go into the free and low cost books, the instant no fuss no muss whispernet delivery. I will say that I love the responsive page turning, the double tap highlight, the COLOR interface (book cover art is important when picking my next read!) I was surprised that I didn't hate the backlighting which by the way, can be adjusted by the user and can be read outside (although admittedly strong sunlight is still an issue).  Not only can you control brightness, you can control the page color (3 choices- white, sepia and black). As on kindle, you can pick your fonts and size. You can mark passages, look up words, and search.  You can read in either landscape or portrait (I find landscape flows better.  I can pull it out anywhere and I don't get the stares I used to when I pulled out my kindle (picture standing in line at the grocery). I love that it doesn't eat my battery. I read an entire book over a 4 hour period and still had over 60% left on my battery on an android phone. The kindle app doesn't have text to speech (that I have found) but that isn't an issue for me. Awesome app and it is free!! You can't go wrong.",5
"I spend monies very nicely with this app! I like that that I can run my finger up and I can increase the light and down to decrease. After a long day on a computer at work it in nice to come home and use this app to increase the size of the wordage by pushing out with my thumb and idex finger, I also like the bookmarking and looking up words. If i used this for studying i can highlight also.",5
I had this installed on my old Android tablet and just installed it on my new one. It works great enabling me to download and read Kindle books. Highly recommended.,5
I carry my books with me on my Smartphone and my Nexus7. No need for an E Reader. I can read books on my devices as well as playing games.Not to mention staying in touch. This App made my devices even more useful.,5
"Wonderful app which lets you not only read books, but also purchase and sync in the app. One of my favorite things is the ability to adjust the default scheme and brightness of the reading area.",5
"It's fine I guess.  It might make more sense if I had an actual Kindle device from Amazon, But alas I do not.",3
This is a great app that is very intuitive yet simple offer everything you could want. It runs very smooth and I have had no problems.,5
This is a great app for the reader that likes to read on their phone or tablet. Kindle has a great library.,5
What a great app for my cell phone.  I load books onto my Kindle Fire HD and then I can also pull them up on my cell phone and it will pick up where I left off on my kindle and when I pick up my kindle again it will sync with phone and move me to the last page I read on cell phone.  Fantastic.,5
"Have been using the app for about a year now.  The older version was much better, responsive and reliable.  Unfortunately since updating the app has been very sluggish and force closes frequently, I was able to find an older version and revert back to it.  2 stars for reading books on my phone, -3 stars for the problems caused by the update and the effort to have to find a previous version without these problems.",2
"This App is the best reader software in my opinion. More flowing and intuitive than the much used readers I have tried. The five stars are deserved for the reading experience despite the missing virtual Home button when used on a tablet with only physical on-off and volume buttons. I expect that will be updated soon. Well Done for a great App!Update: I do not use this app anymore, since it is not needed on my Kindle Fire HD.",5
Great app for anyone who likes to read books on their Android platform.  Worth the few minutes to download it.,5
"I downloaded this for my Android tablet, before I received a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas. It certainly did the trick and was nice to be able to carry my e-books around. This would work nicely on an android phone, I'm sure.",5
"Really neat friends and familyt thought it was neat to read book on phone. Fun to play around with! Download was quick and easy. Try it, kids love it!",4
"I was able to continue to read my book. All was synced up with my iPad. Wonderful, didn't miss a beat. Thank you!",5
in the last round of updates on my android amazon removed the feature allowing me to load my own books into the app via the sdcard. now the only way to get them in is to have a &quot;send-to-kindle&quot; email address wich u can ONLY get if u own a kindle (wich i dont). a very poor decision wich makes this app worthless to me. Installed nook and converted my books to epub with calibre. Apparantly Barnes &amp; Noble want people to use their app. nook color looking more appealing than a kindle right now. /sigh..... i really liked the kindle app to. sad day for me,1
"Standard Kindle program, usable with Kindles or Android based OSs to read Ebooks. Works as always, quite well. Read free books. Become literate. Go you.",5
"Great app for your kindle, ipad or tablet.  I have it on my D2 tablet and love it.  Just a great app.",5
"This is an incredibly useful App. You don't need a kindle to download this. I have a Zeki tablet and I use it all the time. I love horror stories and they have a wonderful selection. It has many others like Romance or History,too.  I'm pretty sure you'll find what you're looking for. They have lots of choices in each category, some are free and others are pretty cheap. Give this a trial run and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",5
I have a tin of books on the android version bought a fire where's my books? It would seem this app does not work on the fire. Very disappointing.,1
"I have a kindle than got a tablet. Now I can just carry one item that fits in my pocketbook and have everything I need with me where ever I go, including all my ebooks!!",5
"I love using the Kindle apps on my iPhone, tablet and our computers, but mainly on the iPhone. So nice to have a book with me so I can read as I wait in line wherever.",5
I don't have a kindle.  I  reinstalled this app for the tablet I purchased for my mom. I just don't use it at all and still prefer real books and magazines to the e-versions.,3
"Don't want to buy a Kindle, because you have an Android Tablet? Then you don't want this program...YOU NEED IT! It functions exactly like the Kindle, without the cost of adding yet another electronic device to your library.",5
This is a great one if caught in place where you find yourself waiting. A little small to read but otherwise great app.,4
"After my wife got a 3G Kindle, I though it might be nice to have a Kindle too, but when I realized I could get an Android tablet that was more portable and more like a PDA than the Kindle, I switched up.  I think I installed the Kindle reader first.  It's a nice implementation and I can't think of anything off hand that I would do to improve the user interface EXCEPT you should be able to see the time while reading.  Doh.  I don't want to have to exit the reader to see what time it is.  Ok, so the Archos 43 has a large screen, and I can see that one might not want to use up the screen real estate that way on a smaller screen - but make it an option then.  Please.  Pretty please.---2012/11/29 Update:  The app can open PDFs, so it is not necessary to have another PDF reader taking up space on your device.  I love that.  I hate that Amazon apps are HUGE and get more HUGE with every update.  This should be App2SD.  I'm going to downgrade my 5 rating to 4 on this point alone.  I love the reader, but the size of the app is making me have to uninstall other stuff to keep it on.  At some point, the Amazon app is going to have to go so I can keep the other stuff on the tablet.  Get a clue Amazon.  You are in the app store business.  When your apps take up all the room on the device, people can't buy other apps anymore!",4
"I love that amazon gives this app away free. Too cool that you can read your amazon content anywhere. Thought it would be too small to read on my phone. I Although it is small and you would not want to read a whole book with this, it is great in a pinch. Just nice to be able to access your library if you need to.",5
"i really feel like I have the real kindle with this app. I love it.... the large print allows me to read it anytime on the go, and fit right into my pocket.",5
I have several books saved as pdf's on my original kindle that i am unable to open in this app. Thats a bummer. Otherwise i like the app,4
"Can't uninstall this app, came pre loaded on the phone. Never downloaded it. Taking up space... Very very annoying. ....",1
I have waited for 3 days for this to show up on my Fire.  I am still waiting.  So I can not say if this is a good app or not.,1
love love love this application. I can store all my e books here and I do not need to have mobile internet service to access these books :),5
Tried to download it and it made me install Amazon Play Store first.  It took up too much memory.  And Kindle never did load.  Gave up and uninstalled Amazon Play Store and never did get Kindle on my Android Phone.,1
"What can I say that others haven't? This app works well. I like how it gauges and displays the time left in each chapter. I also like how that time is continuously updated (like when I stop reading for a bit and then resume). I suppose I mostly appreciate the percentage of the book already read. Really gives me a true location to where I currently am in the book.. this feature also estimates the time to the end when I open a book that I have already read, basing its estimate on how long it took me the last time to read cover to cover. Not necessarily needed info but nice to know what I average from book to book. This app will stay on my RAZR Maxx until I buy a Kindle Fire later this fall.",4
"This is an awesome app.  I don't have a Kindle, but with this app it's like I do.  I love being able to download the apps from the Kindle store(amazon) and they download right to my tablet.  It's awesome.  Get this app!",5
This app is good when you don't have the kindle withyou. It makes it very portable. May use a lot of memory thought...,4
"I downloaded this app on my phone.  I wanted a Kindle, but thought I'd try this first. The app is great, downloads are quick.  It does suck the life out of my battery, though.Great way to try the Kindle family before buying one.  Can't beat the awesomeness of a Kindle.",3
"I love my Kindle HD. But i do not take it everywhere, it's big and i worry about losing it or it getting stolen. I do however, always have my phone. I love being able to use this app on my phone to pick up on a book where i left off on any device i use. I really like how Amazon let's you connect it all. Fabulous and convenient!",5
"Usually I carry my Kindle Fire with me to appointments for reading while taking up space in a waiting room, however, there are times when I am surprised with unplanned time waiting time (waiting for family members to finish shopping, etc.).  Those are the times that I really enjoy the Kindle App.  Several people have asked me how I get a Kindle book to open on my cell phone.  They are totally unaware of the Kindle App.  It is one of the best kept secrets by Amazon Kindle.  I think Amazon should do more open advertising of this hidden feature.",5
"Up until today I would have given this app 5 stars. It is really easy to use which is super important for people like me who are not tech savvy at all. One of the things that I have loved about it is that when I click on the ""store"" button, it takes me to the app version of Amazon. Tonight when I clicked on ""store"", it took me to Amazon's actual Web page which is much more difficult to navigate on my little tablet (Samsung galaxy). I'm hoping this is just a glitch and not an actual change.I had previously installed both the Kindle app and the Nook app, but after a month or so I realized that I liked the Kindle app much better and deleted the Nook app. Now I'm hoping I don't have to go back to that one. Please fix!!Okay. . . so about two days later I figured out that I may possibly have been the one who just didn't know what I was doing. It's back to working for me now, so I have changed my review to 5 stars. Love this app!",5
"Now all my books are gone, freezes when I try to download any of them, locks up my device. I have hundreds of books that I can no longer read on either my tablet or my phone. Please fix this issue.",1
"I'm having trouble getting it to work on my Android device. It was initially working OK, but then it started having this launch problem -- the spinning wheel -- that never ends! Working on a fix for it. Hope it works.",3
I can download Kindle ebooks to my tablet now instead of having to use my Kindle Fire all the time.,5
"Amazon, I've always loved my kindle. I still love my kindle. But the phone app preinstalled with no sign of upgrade or remedy crashes constantly, bringing up an annoying box I have to close.. In the middle of whatever I do. I didn't open the app, I didn't strain it's capabilities.. I couldn't even download a book I own .. Or even my library titles the only time I ever tried to use you weeks ago. What gives?????Please figure it out and get back to being my reading companion.",1
"I can't get any of my books to open on this.  I see them, I download them to the device, but no text.  Not happy.",1
"for Android tablet, laptop and cell phone.  Love the app and the syncing from one device to the other so I'm always able to pick up where I left off no matter which device I'm using.  If you don't have a Kindle, consider downloading and installing the Kindle app so you can take advantage of book downloads!  It's great!",5
"I love my Kindle for Android app! I'm reading books that I love on it, and getting the full effect I would from having an actual book in my hand. There are two suggestions I could make. One is sometimes the words in the book are incorrect, and I don't think it's a typo, because some of the sentences are a mixture of the English language and I think it was French. I've only found two sentences like that. My other suggestion is that maybe the books could be a little cheaper. I don't have the room on my Android tablet to keep all of my favorite books, so I might have to delete them in order to download others. That's a little bit of a waste of money on my part. Thanks for hearing my comments and suggestions!",5
"I've used Kindle for books and magazines and it is, to me, a preferred system.very easy to use. It also has a quick connection to the store to make purchases.Guess I can't say enough about Kindle. It is an excellent reader.",5
This app seems to work fairly well on my Kindle Fire. It is fun for a while. I would recommend it.,4
"I'm so used to it that I don't know what to do without it. Thanks, Thanks, Thank you a lot",5
Good application with a quick download and frequent updates.  I tend to use this app more than Google read due to the selection of downloadable material.,4
This has worked perfectly for me.  I read any time any where I am.  I have fifty or more titles.  It takes no longer to read than on my regular Kindle.  If I forget to take it I have my android Kindle.,5
I love that they made an app where you can access all your kindle book from your other devices. It really is a great app!,5
"Downloaded the Kindle on my phone, my tablet, my ipod and my laptop! Love being able to read where ever I want!",5
Downloaded on my daughters Ipad she loves to read and she reads this everyday. I can download books straight to her ipad easily. Amazon even has free books for her to read.,5
"It is great to be able to read my Kindle books on my phone.  This program originally came on my phone, but got corrupted so I had to re-install it.  It works well with the Kindle in that I can switch between the two and pick up where I was between the two, with no searching.",5
"I like the convenience, although the initial downloading instructions were confusing and frustrating. However, now I'm up and running and it's great! I love my tablet and this app just makes it better.",5
I had enjoyed this app for my phone and then a few days ago it was unfunctional for some reason. I erased it and installed a newer version and it's fine again. I was a bit concerned as I had read from several reviewers that it didn't work on &#34;older&#34; androids. It is fine for my Samsung Galaxy 3. I enjoy the ability of reading in my fire at  home and yet have the ability to read when I'm out and have some free time. It sync's wonderfully and I'm very pleased with it.,5
"Now, I can take my Amazon Kindle books along with me on my phone.  This is wonderful.  I can read them anywhere when I don't want to carry my Kindle with me,",5
who needs an ereader or a tablet when you have this?i can get every book i want and i can read it in a book thesize of my hand. no tablet to lug around. highly recommend.,5
"Downloaded this a couple weeks ago. But it keeps showing up saying Kindle stopped, even though I haven't touched it. I think it's interrupting my phone and other things. I'm gonna try uninstall and reinstall. See what happens.",1
i have friends who have been using it for years. they all love it. so i figured it was time for me to jump on the bandwagon and get started too,5
I broke my kindle and my hubby got me a Nook to replace it.I was really disappointed but with this app on my laptop I'm a happy camper again!Love being able to access my books from my kindle!,5
"My library downloaded this app for me and I have read hundreds of books - novels, history, cookbooks... whatever you like!  I know that there are other readers available, but I don't need to look any further.  KINDLE is the reader for me.  Works great!",5
"I have a Kindle and used it a lot before I got a smartphone. I was hoping I could transfer my user-created Kindle document files, but this app doesn't support that. Big disappointment there.",3
My Kindle stays at home but it is great to get the same book on my phone so if I end up waiting or just bored I can pick up right where I left off on my Kindle by this app being on my phone. then when I get back to my kindle it takes me right back to the page I left off on.,5
This item is perfect for reading. The description says it all. Its the only way to access your kindle books with ease on your android device.,5
I can sync books from either of my Kindles and on my phone. This is great! I can read wherever I go.,5
Works really well.  I love it and use it all the time.  I even got an extended battery for my phone!  Well worth the download.,5
I love being able to get to all my kindle books when ever and where ever I am. The page saving feature is a great help when I go from the phone to the laptop.,5
It works like a charm on my android device.  There are lots of great free books.  I can use it to download books from the local public library.  The app was free.  What's not to love?!?,5
"I like to read and with this app it's easy to do it, specially on the go, love the look and the library so cute.",5
I love my kinde and the ability to use the app in my tablet and phoneAwesome to be able to access my books on other devices,5
"I use both this and Nook for reading ebooks and both work fine. The Kindle is especially attractive and a must have for book readers. Note: owning an Amazon tablet not required as this, like the nook reader app, works on most tablets.",4
"I have been trying to install this app on my Galaxy Tab 2 so I can transfer my book to a single and it will not.  I don't know if the problem is with the Galaxy, I have not been able to get with their customer reps, or with the Kindle app itself.",1
great app for the reader that reads a ton of books. does what its suppose to do and not crash or force close.,5
all my books in one place and everything kept in order and stored in the cloud.  my kindle died on me but i still use the app on my android phone.,5
"I had this app showing in my other Android Tablet, but I got a Kindle Fire now and can't get it to show in my apps. library; why?",5
I love that I can order books and now that Im a prime member once I finish reading my last purchased book I might look for a few free books from the amazon lending library.,5
"have on all my devices,it is great, never never never have to worry bout losing my place in book I am reading, or what book I am reading!!!",5
I have the kindle &amp; this app is great. It doesnt always sync to my kindle  &amp; you cant save to wishlist but you can read in the dark which you cant do with the actual kindle b/c its not backlit.,4
I don't often have my kindle with me when I make quick runs out to the school for example. I almost always have my phone with me. This is very convenient for that reason. I also find it easier to read in bed with a small phone that fits in my hand and has it's own low light.,5
"If I could only have one app this is the one I would have,I have used it for over a year with no problems and the more you use it the more it knows you,finds books you might like too download and they have great offers every day,please download and try it xxx!",5
THIS APP ISNT TOO BAD. I CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE VOICE TO TEXT. THAT WOULD REALLY BE GREAT,4
Nice to be able to put the Kindle app on any device and download books.  I use it for guided meditations on my tabletworking with in Recovery facility.  I find it easy and a very cost effective way to have a lot of options and differentbooks.,5
My husband has no patience with computer programs.  I needed a program that would give him trouble free access to books for his new tablet.  Kindle for Android fits the bill.,5
"I definitely started reading more thanks to this app. just being able have all my books anywhere I go is awesome, well at least for me",5
If you love to read you can't beat kindle.  Tremendous selection of books and magazines.  Easy to use no bugs or problems.,5
This does everything I could ask. Although reading may not be awesome on my phone the app does a lot to help make it as good as possible. Best way to read books on my phone in my opinion (I am invested in the kindle store),5
"Not much to say here, but the Kindle apps work great for Android and Windows Phone.  Great for train rides.",5
Giving us the technology to carry entire libraries of knowledge and volumes of entertainment effortlessly any time and anywhere we want to go!  Of course I love it!,5
"I've had to reload Kindle to my Android 3 times.  I nearly gave up.  Whatever you do, don't try to voice-call anyone at their help line.  Do what you need to do in Chat only.  That way you will have a record of what they tell you.  People don't realize there are other book loaders available who will spam you once you use Kindle, but don't be fooled..  Kindle is the original.",5
What an innovation . . . to be able to download any book that you have in the Amazon library and then read it!  In seconds . . .,5
I really like this app. Absolutely no problems with the install. Immediately downloaded a free book and started playing with the controls. Works great so far.,5
Perfect addition to my kindle.  Works great on my phone running 2.2 &amp; my tablet running 3.1. Amazon is the best!,5
"Not too bad of an app. It's one of the most well-known e-readers for a reason: it's simple to pick up and use - even for those with very little experience with smartphones. The library is simple to browse and find what you're looking for, which seems to be a complaint for a lot of e-readers. It also keeps track of your progress automatically, so if you're the type to read multiple novels at once, then this app is sure to please!Would prefer if there was an easy way to upload / link books from anywhere, but it looks as though you can ONLY read books from the amazon kindle store unless you manually put them on the phone / SD card through a USB cable. Other than that limitation, it works like it's supposed to and doesn't drain the battery too much. Watch out when buying, though! While there are a ton of cheap / free books, and Amazon isn't shy about showing you the more expensive stuff. One-tap ordering means you can easily purchase something you didn't want if you don't pay attention.Overall, it's not spectacular, but it works like it should and is an app that no one should pass up.",4
I have it on my phone and it works wonderful. I can take my books anywhere with me. I really like it.,5
Great app using it on my ipad mini and samsung tab3... Works great that's all i can say.. Thank you.,5
"What a joy to be able to read Kindle books on my android tablet.  This is the most used app on my tablet.  I get library books with my Kindle app.  Easy to read and works 100% of the time.  Easy to book mark.  Makes font large, too!  Love it.",5
"Absolutely love this app. It's great to be able to read my book wherever i am without having to carry something else around with me.A great feature is that it syncs with the PC version,  so i can pick up right where I left off last.I'm not sure that this would completely replace a Kindle for avid readers but it is more than adequate for reading on the run.",5
"I downloaded this for my daughter's HP slate and it works great for her college textbooks, which it compatible with.",5
On Samsung Galaxy Legend works like a champ.  Not everything from Kindle Fire transferred over such as card games or other games.  But the books came wonderfully well,5
"Does what it's supposed to. Using my tablet provides a larger context for reading. When I'm finished reading, I have the functionality of the tablet.",4
My phone already came with a Reader app that works just fine. A friend recommended this one and it is very nice. It works effortlessly and is a very elegant read. Now I have 2. If only I can now find the time to read something :-)Kindle for Android,5
One of the best apps available. My hats off to you with this one. It is extremely easy to download as well as enjoyable going through.,5
"Yay, it was free and it works. what more could you ask for. works great on my new phone. Amazon wireless is neat!",4
"After the recent update, this has become the fattest app on my phone: 15mb WITH it stored on my card.Not very happy that I had to remove a lot of apps just to keep this one.  I almost wish that I could use the cloud reader on my mobile web so I could remove this app.++edit++Flashed CM7 (Android 2.3 based) and it's back to normal. Weird how that works..",4
The Kindle for Android is a piece of junk and Amazon should be ashamed to even have it on their web site for download! The GARBAGE doen't work!! It won't let you read any of your purchased books!!!,1
"Not sure how this even got in the race, for I do not use this app either. Suppose it is good, but I do not even have a Kindle!",3
"Now I can take all of my favorite books with me, no matter where I may be! I absolutely love it and recommend it. I use a straight talk prepaid android phone, and it works perfectly!",5
I use this on my android phone and love it. It is a little hefty on the memory aspect (at least for my little phone--11.5MB) but it WILL install to the internal memory so that helped a lot.,5
"It downloaded and installed quickly, but wouldn't do anything else.  I would think they'd want to have versions that work on more than just the latest hardware.",2
I really love this app. I have it on all my devices and my kindle Fire of course.What would really put this over the top is a widget for my phone's home screen.Or an app developed just for this that can be downloaded separately.I would love to be able to read directly from my home screen. and to browse my books that way too.,5
"My son gave me this for my birthday.  What an incredible present.  I use it daily, take it with me all the time.",5
Very nice app for ready books.I like the backgrounds availableparticularly the SEPIA. It makesfor easy reading. I also own a regularkindle and use both of them as syncingis possible.,5
"I never planned on buying e-books, I was more than happy just using a print book. That just changed, I received an Android tablet (10.7 inch) for my birthday in January, and didn't do much with it until recently. I was in Amazon App store to download a timer for poker when I came across the Kindle app. So I downloaded that as well, while looking to order a new book from one of my favorite authors, I noticed that he had written several short stories for the Kindle only. I ordered the stories, and was delighted with the ease of operation in downloading to the tablet, the ease in reading while in bed, on the couch, room lights on or off. I am definitely a believer in e-books now. I still like print books for the beach and pool, but the Kindle is great for the other times that weather is not an issue for electronics. Definitely recommend this to all the readers out there.",5
I updated my kindle last night and now it won't even open! Very upset as I paid for some of those books. Please fix! It worked before I updated. I enjoy the kindle app but recently the updates are so big I had to choose between some other apps to put the update in. Going to delete and re-install. If it doesn't work I'm calling custmer service for my money back on the books I paid for.,1
"I like having access to my books on all my devices - two tablets, two home and one work computer.Kindle does the job and keeps everything in sync.",5
I love that I now can see the cover of the book I am reading. Thumbs up! A great free app.,5
"Today (2/19/14) I installed the latest update.  My carousel WAS set up with books I'd like to read next.  Now, my carousel contains every Kindle book I've ever read, including library books that have been returned.  I now have to go through and delete hundreds of books from my carousel!  What genius thought that one up!?!  Please fix this!",2
"I find that having my books on my phone (Droid Razr Maxx, so big screen and no battery problem) is more convenient than carrying around a 2nd device.  This app is great - not only for Amazon books but also checking out library ebooks in Kindle format. I haven't read this much since high school!  It's a Must to install.  Also, I haven't had any problems with it.",5
"Love, Love my Kindle Fire.  Have had for a year and am so happy with this purchase. Don't need to lug my lap top around as can get all my emails, music, books.  Can order from your sites.  Must have for me.",5
I like all the features on this app. Easy to use just like stand alone kindle. Only draw back is screen is dark.,4
"I find I go to the 'Table of Contents' often to reread a chapter or go to a favorite chapter. I was also using a Kindle Bible in church to quickly jump to the  'Table of Contents' then to the chapter (Book) I wanted. After this last update there is no '2 touch' go to contents any more. In fact the ""Table of Contents"" in the menu will not even take you to a  'Table of Contents'. To change books in the Bible I have to:1. go to the menu2. choose Navigation3. from there I can choose  'Table of Contents'4. choose book5 choose chapterBy then it is too late. Other books don't have a ""Navigation"" choice. How about a 'Go to  'Table of Contents' ' in the  'Table of Contents' tab...come on this is common sense. Why even call it  'Table of Contents' if it does not take you there.",2
I have to say I am impressed with it. It will be a pleasure for me to e-read. Can barely wait to purchase my reads.,5
Works nice to read my Kindle books on my cell phone.  makes what I invest in books very reasonable! Like it.,5
"Very good app that keeps my books all in one place and easy to read. I really wish the Android for Smartphones version could take advantage of print replica Kindle books but that is not a fault of the app but of Amazon. Smartphones of today have the ability to read these prints, just not edit them. It would be that much more convenient for me. Maybe in the future?",5
"I use this app to read my Kindle books on my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  It works great, and the screen on my smartphone turns into a smaller Kindle - complete with Carousel.  I have switched devices while reading books and can quickly return to the farthest read location.",5
"What is there to say.  This is Kindle, one of the top e-reading devices on the planet.  I got one on my first computer and I've never looked back.If you like to read you need this.  Computer, tablet or any device it is available for!",4
Amazon is the easiest place to find the books I want. The prices are always lower than anywhere else and I almost always find what I'm searching for. Having the Kindle for my android makes it affordable and convenient.,5
I use it all the time to read many books on my android tablet. Its perfect and easy to use.,5
This application is fantastic. Especially for people who enjoy reading and receiving book in seconds rather than waiting for a very long time to get physical books.,5
I enjoy being able to read on my laptop and the take up where I left off on my android phone.,4
"I have a Kindle and recently bought an android...I downloaded the KIndle app and it's great.  I use it ONLY for color books/magazines, otherwise I use my actual Kindle.  The ONLY complaint I have is that occasionally the app crashes.  Not a major problem but it can get annoying at times.",4
"I love it. i can read the books I have on my PC. There is no difference between the kindle reader on the PC, laptop, and tablet. Works great. Recommend to anyone that have the kindle reader on their laptop and want to read their books on the go on thrie tablet.",5
"This have proven to be a very essential tool that is very effective and useful.  I use it on a daily basis for reading books, it addition it is effective in helping my duaghter to read more.",5
i absolutely love this app. If my wireless is on the book syncs to the last page read. It's like a small version of Kindle. Love it!,5
"This is wonderful. I have Kindle books on my android phone. What could be better? I have the phone, and I have my books with me at all times.",5
"I have enjoyed this program more than anything I've ever had. Even my local library. Loads of free books, easy access, and easy to use.",5
"My wife and I are avid readers and have a substantial Kindle library.  We both used the older Kindle tablets that didn't have the back lit screen, so always needed some kind of additional lighting if reading in a dim area or in the evening.  I decided to download this app for my Nexus 7 and am quite pleased with it.  I am able to access the entire library and read in darkened areas without fumbling with some type of additional light source.  It has been great for reading while on airplanes, camping or when I'm some place where lighting isn't adequate to read from my old Kindle tablet.  I also downloaded it on my wife's Ipad as well as the kid's Coby tablet, but have not tried it on the Coby as of yet.  The downside is, the Nexus 7 and Coby have to be in a area where there's WiFi access to download from Amazon or access books in our stored library, whereas, the Kindle tablet has fairly reliable satellite access, similar to a cell phone.  This is not a big problem, as I download several books to the Nexus 7 memory before I go anywhere there may be limited or no WiFi access.",5
I have used almost all of the E-readers but I think Kindle is the best.  Easy to use but powerful.  And I like being able to have all my devices synced to the same page easily.,5
kindle for Android is really great.  I have it on my phone and I don't have to take my tablet with me all the time.  Just grab my phone and go.  Love it,5
"Turns my phone into a kindle pretty much which I already have a kindle so it makes them extremely interactive, which is actually kinda cool. The app came with my phone so I? Didn't purchase it, wouldn't have either but that's just because I already have a kindle.  App works though.",5
"Now I will never be without my books!  Got them on my Kindles, got them on my tablet, got them on my phone.  Life is good.",5
It is a great program so you can read your eBooks in your tablet or android cellular phone. I just love it,5
"The app is very useful for us that dont have a KNDLE, I install it in my NEXUS 7 to have access to AMAZON vast services and selections and it work very well, I activate a few magazine subscriptions and order books which I recomend specially to thouse like me that CAN'T tae full advantage of GOOGLE services because they dont offers them outside the US STATES.GOOGLE would not let me order, music,books,magazines or use services like Navigation etc etc, I just bought a new KINDLE HDX 7 due to GOOGLE limitations in my country which is a US territory. Let see when my KINDLES arrive !!!",5
Lets any smartphone work with Kindle book site and downloads.  Reasonable alternative to a tablet if you eyes are good.,5
"I have kindle fire, and I have a Nexus 7, and I use Kindle on my Samsung phones. I love this program for reading books. It is a must have for any tablet, along with PDF reader.",5
i downloaded this app on my google nexus so i could read books through purchase and borrower. I love this app.,5
Won't work on my Nextbook 7 even though it is identical to my sister's (app works on it).Keeps loading Amazon App Store.,1
My husband and I have the same exact tablet. Kindle works on his and will not on mine. Soo vastly disappointed!,1
The Kindle Apps are always good.  I have many books to read anywhere I am now.  I also recommend the Kindle for the computer.,5
I really like my apps and I use then all the time.  I am always on the go and I really use each and every one. I love that I can purchase the apps that I'm interested in and I can use them right away. I can always have my reading with me.,5
I love the app because it works very effectively when I want to purchase any of my interests in books and movies,5
I really like this app.  It could use some tweaking.  I would like to have more options for sizing and shading of the background.,5
This is an excellent app for reading Kindle books on your Android tablets or phones. It works flawlessly without a hitch.,5
I love kindle better than barnes and noble if you want to find booklending.com or fee listings this is the way to go.,5
"if you love to read, you need the kindle app on your device. easy to purchase and rent books from the library - awesome app",5
I read all the time.  I love to be able to take my books with me in my pocket note an extra bag. I do love the feel of a book in my hand too. This is more convenient.,5
"Amazon makes their Fire from Android but, refuses to give customers using Android Tablets the X-Ray feature...  If you look at the iOS App, they delivered the X-Ray feature for the iPad so, making Android users feel like second class citizens will have many of us running to Google or Barnes and Noble for our E-Books and honestly, both of those are better reading Apps.",3
"This app has started to lag behind both its major competitors and the smaller readers.  Come on Amazon, we know you can do better.",2
It been one of the Best appr. I gotten. I use almost every day the One on My PC didn't work as well the one for My PAD,5
It is a excellent application for reading electronic books. The text size can be adjusted to what is comfortable for the reader.,4
This app shows 2 pages at once.  It is so nice to be able to read my books on a larger tablet,3
"Great resource for reading books on the go, on your phone.  Access to thousands of free books on Amazon.",4
I have purchased dozens of electronic books along side of my hard backs and I am thrilled to be able to add these books to my bookshelf with un cracked bindings and still read them in the electronic format.,5
"This last Up-Date? Great!! The improved dictionary access is wonderful. This completes with my full size kindle &amp; better (pre-Fire Kindle). Plus the other functions, makes this the best e-reader around as far as I'm concern. Highly recommend!!",5
"Works well. I don't own a kindle but this app works well on every Android device I've ever owned, even cheap ones. Phone or tablet. I even have it on my laptop. Although I do have other ebook readers, this is my go to app most of the time because of the huge and unusual assortment of reading material on Amazon. Lots of free content as well.",5
"Had absolutely no problems with this program on my tablet, and love being able to read books whenever or wherever I am at.",5
"You've got Nook, iBooks, Google Books and then you have Kindle.  I've never owned a Kindle device but plan on buying one at some point even though I don't need to.  I get my books on all my devices whenever I need them.  If I buy from iBook or Google Books then I can only use them through their services.  I'll stick with Kindle's fantastic selection and broad device support.",5
"Works very nice for my Kindle books, but haven't figured out how to (or if it's even possible) to have the computer read it like it did on my Kindle Keyboard.  Doesn't come up often, but I've kind of wished I had it available a couple of times.  That's the only drawback I see.It is very easy to navigate, and easy to put items on or take item off your device.  Actually, it's easier than with my old Kindle!  Easy to download your books from the cloud.  Easy, easy, easy!Love it!",5
"Forget the Ipad,Ipad2,Ipad 3,Nook,Blah Blah Blah- If you want it all -Then get a Kindle. That is all you have to do!",5
The only thing that I see is that there needs to be an opportunity to place the books in Reading order & to be able to add a few notes if the person wants!  REALLY the Reading Order is a MUST! To also be able to place them into Authors folders to access only that author is you want would be a plus that would be nice!!!! They do this on Amazon in the Wish Lists Why not be able to allow this in the APP!!!,5
"Due to publisher restrictions, some titles may not be wirelessly delivered to your device and instead require USB transfer from your computer to your device. These restricted titles also may not be accessed on Kindle reading applicationsThis quote appeared on my library's website as I was trying again and again to download a restricted book. I know kindle may not have much to do with this problem, but couldn't you provide some understandable documentation about how to download via usb to a computer in order to get it to an android reader, as opposed to a Kindle, or an off market reader? And what does the last line even mean?I never, ever get the drop down box to transfer to the usb and I can only assume it is the Android Device, but still, some documentation would help.",3
"Didn't want to buy a Kindle as I had a iPad and iPhone so I downloaded this full function app from them. I think I got this one for the kids with there tablets. It turned out they didn't use google play so I put the Amazon app and got this from here. Great app, works fine and gets updated regularly.",5
This has been great. Easy to download and install on my tablet and has given me many more books to chooe from.Woody,5
This the app you need to always have your book with you.  It is great to be open your book anytime you can.,5
"The older kindle app worked perfectly on my LG optimus, but the up-to-date version is such a memory hog that it freezes my Samsung. Totally disappointing! An e-book reading app should not do that. I can use Aldiko and Google Play Books with no problem, but I have a kindle e-reader and want my books in sync on my phone. Please fix it Amazon!",1
"I am a huge Kindle fan. I have, to date, bought one for: myself, my wife, 3 of my sisters, and soon to be a 4th sister.  However, unless I will be traveling, or unless I plan to sit down and read for an extended period of time, I tend to not want to carry around the full-sized Kindle reader device with me.  I would prefer to use my phone, or read on my computer.  Enter the Kindle reader for the Android. It works beautifully.  It auto-syncs when you first start it, and then you can turn pages by slide-gesturing, or using the arrow keys on the keypad (if you have a keypad on your Android phone). You can also highlight, and annotate, as well as increase or lower font size, line spacing, etc.  The only thing it won't do, is read to you like the Kindle can do, when you enable screen-reading.  Not too shabby for a free application.Battery drain while using it to read non-stop for 2 hours was about 35% of my total battery life, on a battery which will give me 4 hours with constant use, with a full charge.  Not bad, but not fantastic, either.  However, the Samsung Galaxy Indulge has pretty terrible battery life in general (I always carry a spare with me), so take that estimate with a grain of salt, your mileage may vary.",5
This app for my  Samsung Galaxy S III works quite well and I have had no issues with it - recommended for other Android devices.,4
I found it worked just like a kindle and I did not have to buy another piece of equipment.  It is also easy to use.,5
It does everything I need it to do.,4
Don't really read unless I have to puts me to sleep. Would be nice if it would have an option for audio book.,3
Love being able to read my books wherever I go. Easy to use & easy to find new items to read.,5
"Like a few other reader apps out there, the Kindle app is good. I have Amazon Prime and this app but they won't count that for the lending library. :(",4
"I just deleted this from my phone, as much as I didn't want to.  My phone was low on memory and this app was one of the biggest reasons.  I thought, &quot;No problem, I'll just move it to my SD card.&quot;. No such luck, it can't be moved with my non-rooted phone.  I decided to delete this rather than suffer issues (and notifications) due to low memory.",3
I love this app. Really makes it handy to read alot of random short stories while on the and not loose your place in the book.  Its a very handy app.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Amazon also offers alot of free kindle books where as they charge for the paperback versions.,5
Lets have my books at times when I don't want to bring my Kindle with me.  It's just important to remember to sync each devicel,4
It's just like having a Kindle only better.  You can get to your Kindle books and still use your tablet for online use.  The best of both worlds,5
the upgrade has a very nice screen with moving book icons and it is easy to flick thru all the library content.,5
"Pros: Great for reading on a 9"" tablet. Love the black background, white text and ability to change brigtness right on screen. Changing font size is awesome. Love the ability to read one sample chapter.Cons: I cannot use the app to integrate with Library nor use Kindle Lending Library. Wish Amazon permits for prime members like Prime Videos.",5
"I tried many readers, kindle is great for PDFs and many other file types besides the Kindle books, and makes reading of Kindle purchases easy and I trust the security. Also love the sync between devices. Thanks Amazon. Works good on Galaxy SII phone and Galaxy Note 10.1",5
"Everything you love about your Kindle is now on your Android phone! I love this app because it allows me to pick up reading a book where I left off reading on the PC or other Kindle device.The recent addition of access to public library books is great! (However, this still needs to be done via the Internet outside of the app - hopefully they will integrate into the app in the future) I can borrow books from my public library for free for 2 weeks at a time! I love this, I will probably save a good deal of money in late fees because when the lending period expires, the book is automatically returned! No need to worry about getting to the library to return a book in order to avoid late fees!This app is constantly updated and improved as well, but it has been extremely good for quite some time now. I love that the reading background colors, brightness, text size, and word spacing can all be adjusted to fit your needs or preferences.A great way to make good use of my time while in waiting rooms!",5
"I don't know how I would survive without Kindle,having it available  on my tablet means I can take it with meeveryware",5
I use this app a lot to open PDF's.  I have trouble with my document writer not showing all the pictures from them.  I had not had any trouble with the standard uses of it either.,5
"This app comes packed with a great array of features that make it a mobile app. If you use the Kindle service to buy books then this is perfect. Download this app on all of your devices and you can easily read on the go and have your data synced. But remember, this app is only useful if you use Kindle books. Great to have though!",5
I love to read and I like this kindle app.  I have a lot of books I can download and read.  I like the free books offered too.,5
Such a user friendly app can always find what I need ! Kindle has made my reading experience a joy ! I have low vision and I can set up and read again ! Thank you amazon !,5
"I like Kindle.  It is a great concept.  I wish amazon wasn't quite so stingy with sharing books and what not, but it is a good step in the right direction.",4
I already have a nook. I do not like paying for books. I found a website that finds free books for you. I found a book that I wanted but don't have a kindle. So I turned my 7 &#34; tablet into a kindle. Great! Now I don't have to bring both with me when I go somewhere. I just bring my tablet now!,5
"I like the fact that I can adjust the background light on the droid, which I can't do on my old Kindle.  I still use the Kindle a lot, but it's nice to have options.",5
"Smooth working app, no negative issues.  Downloaded several books initially, no problems accessing or viewing.  Look forward to using extensively.",5
i l[ke the books and the price is fair. I think the E books are very reasonable and shipping is fair price.,4
If you phone has the space I highly recommend this app.  Easy to use and lots of free books to choose from.,5
If you have a nexus 7 tablet you need this to download books from your local library.so glad amazon gives this download for free (thanks folks),5
"I bought a very inexpensive tablet. android ice cream sandwich  Zeki, 7&#34; tablet.  Installed this kindle app and now can enjoy my faux &#34;kindle&#34;.",5
Who needs a dedicated e-reader when you can read the same thing on your tablet. I don't think you lose any features at all,5
"I like the app and it is a great companion to the kindle's. the file size is way to big. I am on the fence about keeping it on my phone. as far as the app goes, it works flawlessly.  if you have one of the newer phones with plenty of RAM you will love it. but I have the HTC Desire and not a lot of room to begin with.",3
"This app allows one to download and read Kindle books on a tablet and as I titled this review, it is flawless. It keeps track of where you are in the book so you can start and stop in a flash and never miss a word, even after shutting down the device and then picking it up the next day. It is also free, yea!",5
We can now access Kindle on our phone. I am grateful  for this app and recommend it to all android owners.,5
"i love the fact I could download this onto my netbook and wpdn 2.0 I love to read and find it's much easier to download then "" old borders"". I can download the book here and read it there. YeaH!!",5
"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVELIMITED SIGHT, OR ARE BLIND. IT EVEN READS TO YOU.",5
Great tool and very easy to use.  Has made my life much easier now that I have some of the apps.  Would recommend this product to others,5
"My husband was given an Award where he works and as a result we got 2 Android pads...so, I gave my Kindle Fire to my daughter. So, when I saw the Kindle app I immediately downloaded it and was amazed at how well it worked - thanks Amazon for not being afraid to share!",5
"I truly wanted Nook Color, but it takes up a ton of space and the books are more expensive. Sticking with Kindle. HTC EVO 4G",5
"I would have given it five stars if it weren't so SLOW to load!  It works fine, but loads extremely slowly.",4
The kindle is great to have. What I like most about it? I can take it everywhere. I truly would recommend it.,5
Go my parents hooked on kindle and reading some of my favorite books.  The best invention ever.  No more bulky books just my app!,5
"I love this app. Now, waiting for an appointment is easy. I pull out my Smartphone and read a book.",5
So glad they came out with this app for the tablet. Works on my Nabi2 just fine. Quick downloads and lots of books to choose from. Thanks Amazon!,5
"I downloaded to my Stratosphere phone. It works great. I am pleased that I can have my Kindle ebooks in the cloud,  wherever i go!",5
"I used to love having kindle for android in my phone, but since the last update my phone and kindle account go crazy every time I try to use it. It's creating multiple accounts for the same phone on Amazon (nine accounts last time I checked), won't undo the update, shots down on its own if it opens at all, and freezes my phone. Amazon, do something!",1
"I used the PC version until I crashed my Windows OS, and went Linux. Kindle is a Linux system, but not compatible with Linux PC OS's so I got it for my Android E-reader instead. Very easy to download, easy to use, no problems or complaints so far! Beats the other guy's offerings, ,IMHO.",5
"As a reader I enjoy Kindle because it allows me to have a whole library on one flash drive or hard drive.One thing I would like is access to more fonts and sizes, still trying to find the best font for reading off an lcd screen.",5
Loaded my first book with ease.  I am surprised that there isn't a high tech book mark in the application.,5
"I couldn't get this to  work at all on my Android, now I have  for some reason I have something wrong with my device",1
This app is fantastic . A lot of content to choose from and many books are freeIt also has an easy to use dictionary that is built into the Kindle reader. This is oneof my favorite apps of all!,5
"Kindle is good and useful idea and app. I don't get a lot a time to read but, I don't have to look for another book I misplaced. It's on my phone or tablet; now if only I could remember where I put my keys.",5
"I have a low end tablet that wouldn't allow me to download the last update.  I had to install a 2 Gigabit micro SDHC card and put this app on that card.  It is slow because of the program location, but eventually works.",4
"Overall functions well, although controls could be a bit more obvious.  Haven't really explored full availability of books.",4
"I love to read and was the one who carried around ALL the books I was currently reading.  Anyone else who reads know that's a real back breaker!  I have this app on all my major reading electronics ( my Cruz Tab, my pc,  my Android phone and Galaxy Tab). Renders well on all except G. Tab. The splash screen is off,  so it doesn't fit screen.  Love having all my books with me at all times, love I can read whatever whenever however whyever... lol.  Syncs flawlessly,  adjustable fonts, different lighting levels... ;)  Only thing it needs are real page numbers and real in book dictionary.  NEVER liked the Kindle ereader cause I believe it you're gonna drop hundreds on electronica it better do more than one ghing... JMO.  Great app! Thanks!",5
"I have used the Apple version of this apps for several years, and I think this android version is as good, if not better. The text is very clear, easily resized for viewer preference, and I like having direct access to the Amazon on-line book store.",4
I love it and can not express in words how much. Think my favorite so far is &#34;Not a Sparrow Falls&#34;,5
"I have a Kindle Fire and I take it with me everywhere I go.  Occasionally, it will run out of battery at a very inconvenient time and I have been able to transition over to continue on my phone very smoothly.Once, horrors, I actually thought the Kindle was in my purse, only to arrive at a restaurant on my own, intending to eat and read, to discover I did not have my Kindle with me.  I was able to move right onto the Kindle app on my Droid and be completely happy.It is a well arranged app - and while not a Kindle, it definitely does the job very, very well.",5
Love this app!  Now I can continue reading my book while on the go without having to take my Kindle with me.  Love being able to sync my progress with all my devices.,5
I'm not much of a reader but I've got a big collection of &#34;who done its&#34; and I'll be flipping pages more often with this...no more &#34;dog eared&#34; pages lol,5
This is the one app I could not do without.  i travel frequently and am often in very rural areas with no signal.  My books are always there.  i do keep 5-10 in my library unread so I can always read even when nothing else is working.,5
"I've had the Kindle app on my EVO phone since last November, about ten minutes after I got the phone. The app works smoothly, and I've had no problems with it at all. I enjoy having some books with me on my phone; it's surprising how often I read something using the Kindle app on my phone when I'm waiting for an appointment somewhere. I still carry and use my Kindle 3, but this app has turned my phone into a very handy supplement to the Kindle. Syncing to the ""furthest location read"" between and among my Kindle-equipped devices has always been easy and accurate.",5
"Love this app and the ability to quickly obtain Amazon books. So many choices! Would have been five stars, but a paid-for book was taken off without my knowledge or my ability to get it back.",4
Love having this option on my phone even though I have a kIndle.  I can read books when I have my phone and not have my Kindle with me.,5
This is the next to best thing if you don't have a Kindle.  I love being able to have books on my phone!,5
"Up until today I would have given this app 5 stars.  It is really easy to use which is super important for people like me who are not tech savvy at all.  One of the things that I have loved about it is that when I click on the ""store"" button, it takes me to the app version of Amazon.  Tonight when I clicked on ""store"", it took me to Amazon's actual Web page which is much more difficult to navigate on my little tablet (Samsung galaxy).  I'm hoping this is just a glitch and not an actual change.I had previously installed both the Kindle app and the Nook app, but after a month or so I realized that I liked the Kindle app much better and deleted the Nook app.  Now I'm hoping I don't have to go back to that one.  Please fix!!Okay. . . so about two days later I figured out that I may possibly have been the one who just didn't know what I was doing.  It's back to working for me now, so I have changed my review to 5 stars.  Love this app!",5
The latest update is HUGE &amp; I've been frantically uninstalling stuff from my phone in order 2 keep it  - may just have 2 give it up.,3
I have this on my Arnova tablet and it works well.  Very easy to use and understand.  Amazon is one of my fav sites and has made my life so much easier.  My only complaint is that on my tablet I cannot read the first or second sentence on the top of each page b/c there is a status bar there.. At one point last week it went away and i had the book on my entire screen but i have no idea how i got it that way and it hasn't happened since then.  If anyone knows how to fix this i would greatly appreciate the help!,4
"Its Kindle. Not much to say it doesnt crash and seems to work ok so far. I would recommend this, the app for PC and even the handheld device... it seems like one of the better tech devices made in the last while. Recommended.",5
Thankfully Amazon made this apple available for android device owners; especially those who have purchased books via Amazon. The app allows you to easily access all your purchased Kindle books.,5
Downloaded it onto my smart phone.  Works very good and shows all my books that I have on my Kindle Fire.,5
Has just about everything my Kindle HD provides including the book is really on my Nexus 5 Smartphone. The only thing it doesn't do is audio or I would have given it 5 stars.,4
Forget the Nook/Kindle Arms race... I can get both Nook and Kindle apps on my high-powered tablet and phone.Why should I spend EXTRA money on a specific brand? Love that they branched out with these.,5
"I love that I can read books on my phone.  There are many, many free books to download and read.",5
"The GUI on this isn't the best, but it is pretty straightforward nonetheless. The only thing I would like to see added to this app is a way to do a one-touch download of all books purchased. I scanned through and ordered about 50 books from my computer, thinking they would automatically get sent to my tablet, but they didn't. The covers do, but then you hav eto go through one by one to download the books themselves. I'd rate 5 stars if not for this.",4
Very dependable and easy.  I've used it with my Kindle Fire for over a year and it's excellent. Highly recommend.,5
"I loved this app and until recently it was amazing.  Now there are two issues currently affecting it.1.  Books which were recently read will come up as no longer being recognized.  It will then either require me to attempt to open it several times, or delete and redownload the book.2.  The time left grows significantly during the reading of each chapter.  I will go from 15 mins left on the first page of a chapter to 36 minutes left on the last page of the chapter.  I know my reading speed hasn't changed, but about every 2-3 pages, it likes to add a minute to the remaining time.I am currently using the Note 3, however the 2nd problem also existed on the Evo 4G I was using for a bit.Once these two items are taken care of, I will be more than happy to change it back to a 5-star rating, as this truly is one of the better reading apps.",3
"Not only is this a must-have app for Kindle readers, but it is one of my favorite apps for reading generic PDF files. I use it instead of the PDF reader.",5
"Why??? Runs horribly now even on a dual core and is literally 10 times larger than a year ago and for what? Please, please stop this and optimize this app!!!! I hate giving it one star but there is no excuse for this. And WHY do you store the book data in the app/system space instead of of user/sdcard storage space? AND when one deletes (archives) a book, why doesn't the app remove it from local storage? Why are these very basic housekeeping functions and storage decisions so poorly implemented? :(",1
Trying to run the latest version on android 4 on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Application is very unstable and crashes forcing a deletion and reinstall along with bringing all of the books from the archives back into the program. This is required at least 1 time per day. It would be very nice to see a fix come down for whatever has gone wrong.,2
"Read your Kindle books & magazines on your Android-powered phone or tablet! You can sync your books/magazines so, for example, you can read on your phone and continue from the same place on your tablet.",5
"Great app that allows you to read Kindle books (.mobi) on an android machine.  None of the android readers I found, including Aldiko, which I LOVE, have the .mobi capability.  This works, enough said.",5
"Okay, don't buy a kindle. Who needs the extra expense or weight to carry around, especially when you can add the app to your phone for free!  Man, I own a kindle and added the app to my phone to quit carrying my kindle around ('til I bought my Fire HD, but that's another story).",5
"I don't know why some people give this app lower ratings.  It offers a huge number of free books and tons of books at extremely low prices compared to buying paperback.  I love being able to have so many book options at my fingertips right at home and not have to go out to a book store to shop for them.  If you don't like having to buy books from the app, simply don't buy them.  How hard is that?",5
I use the app all of the time to continue reading my Kindle books.  It's one of the most used apps on my Thrive tablet.,5
easily the best reading application and ecosystem any where. They allow more flexibility than all their competitors and they offer the best stand alone e-reader on the market,5
Just a great extension of my kindles.  Great program that combines functionality with ease.  It means I do not have to carry my kindle with me to Chesterton Society meetings.,5
The app works great and I use it all the time.I still have books that I did not buy that keeps being displayed on it and I cannot delete it. It also shows up on my Kindle for PC too but not on my Amazon online account. I have contacted Amazon many of times about this but they cannot help me.,4
I collect books and since I cannot afford them right now this app solved ALL my reading problems.  I am SO happy I can use this app. I can take hundreds of books with me and not look like the nerd I really am!,5
"Forcing me to sign in and reload books daily. Amazon saids its a issue with the Galaxy S3 with Jelly Bean, with no idea of a fix. Overseas call center is useless and can't speak enough English to understand.  Very disappointed, I've used app for many years with no issues on many phones.",1
I put this on my son's tablet.  He loves to read and there are so many choices with the amazon app.  Easy to use.,5
My husband is absolutely crazy about this. He also has the kindle nook and they go hand in hand! Thanks,5
ebooks have completely changed how much I read. It used to be never but now I read almost daily. So much more convenient than carrying books around.,5
So sorry to say that I really can't review this app because it never downloaded to my device. I've never had any problems with other devices in which I rate the app 4 stars. I have The Galaxy S4.,1
I like the fact that I can read on my kindle or my phone. All my books are synced between devices. This is a great app to have.,5
"I couldn't find the software I was accustomed to using for reading e-books from the library.  Out of desperation, I tried the Kindle app on my new device.  It works. I am able to download e-books with ease, and see them on the screen in the way that pleases me. That is all I ask from an e-reader app.",5
"It's Kindle, what can you say?  Works beautifully every time.  I prefer to use this as the default reader on my nexus 7.",5
Love this app-I borrow library books and unless they were on Overdrive I could not read them on my phone-now I can!,5
"On windows 8 you can use apps!  I have not really used this application as of yet, but I did download a book.",4
I recommend this wonderful app. I read all of my books this way. I can the print as I CAN ENLARGE IT OR read it regular and the print is dark and the light at the back is great and i have a really wonderful collection of books to read.,5
"Excellent reader, must have for any platform",4
"i have had the kindle app on my phone, ever since i knew i could get it.  the text is easy to read although small, it is clear and easy to use.  Since most of us never leave our phones at home, it is much easier to carry our books with us this way. and it's free too.Kindle for Android",4
"I don't know where I'd be without both my Kindle and my new Kindle Fire!  I bought my first Kindle when I had my shoulder op. Wow,  how have I ever managed without it? But be WARNED,  if you start a library,  make sure you keep your old email address and password if you decide to change your email address to a new one.  Libraries are not transferable.  I DID NOT KNOW THAT!  Now I have two libraries. Something Amazon needs to work on. Just sayin'",5
"While there are a lot of good ebook readers available, this one makes it particularly easy to use with your amazon account, especially if you own a kindle already, and want to share the content with an android device.",5
"I have been told to insall this app for a while but have been hesitant to do so. Since braving the world of reading apps, I have finally installed kindle and have been surprised with it's versatility. I would recommend this app to anyone who requires a easy to use, and easy to read application.",4
"The only problem is the smaller than Kindle-sized screen, which makes me turn pages more often. I don't use it as much now that I have an actual Kindle, but it is handy for times when I don't want to carry a purse big enough for the Kindle but I do have to wait in line or for something to happen (like before the movie starts at the theater).",5
"This app is super for people who love to read. You can keep it stored in reading it.In my opinion the recommend is excellent, I really like the enjoy. Could give you the opportunity to have her on your android.",5
I like being able to read my Kindle books from my phone when I am away from my Kindle. It works great.,5
"These may seem like minor, insignificant complaints to you, and they would be if there were any legal alternative to the Kindle app.  Unfortunately, when I buy an ebook on Amazon, I'm locked in to their apps/devices, so I can't read the book the way I want.  Amazon isn't doing me a favor by making an ebook app that works for me, they owe it to me.Margins:When I read a physical book, there are reasonable margins.  When I read a DRM-free ebook on a feature-rich open source e-reader app on my galaxy tab, I have reasonable margins between the edge of the screen and the edge of the tablet.  When I read a Kindle ebook on the Kindle app on my galaxy tab, I have EXTRA LARGE margins in portrait mode thanks to the built in, non-configurable software margins.  When I tilt the tablet a few degrees too far to the right or left (surprisingly easy to do when you have the tablet tilted back a little), I get EXTRA LARGE margins on the top and bottom of the screen, and DELUXE SUPER JUMBO margins on the right and left.Screen Rotation:On my phone, the Kindle app is great.  The software margins aren't an issue since my phone doesn't have built in margins around the screen, and I can tell the Kindle app not to change orientations when I tilt the phone by pressing a mysterious lock icon that appears when I tilt it.  On my tablet, the Kindle app team has decided that users don't like locking the screen rotation, so they've completely removed that feature.  They say that it's easy to lock the screen rotation in Android 3.0, but it's actually only one click less to lock the screen in Android 3.0 than to lock it in Android 2.X, plus there's the fact that I don't want to have to enter Kindle App Mode every time I try to read a Kindle ebook.The only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than one is because the Kindle app is still at least twice as good as the Barnes and Noble Nook app, for what it's worth.",2
"I've played this on other devices but, it doesn't work on the nabi 2, or maybe this game is no good at all.",1
this game stays the same the entire time you play. no different levels. falldown classic in the amazon app store is better and more fun. don't buy this app.,1
"i do like this game cuz its very addicting. the screen just shakes a bit, but its still really fun.",4
amazing game for my kindel fire.I'm not lying I'm telling u strate up.I love it.the other folks.with kindel fire u must have an old.one.my is very new. but anyways best game ever.u need confidence. and stragity.I mean it is a stragity game .so again best game for kindle fire! ^_^,5
"Does not work on Kindle Fire, the directions run off of the bottom of the screen so you can't read them.  The graphics are VERY pixelated and the game doesn't. respond.  uninstalled, don't waste your time with this",1
I love this game I play it all the time I just cant get enough of it I us to play it on my friends but now I can just buy it off the kindle fire :),5
Paid for and downloaded the APP. My phone just &#34;spins&#34; when I open it trying to retrieve the &#34;license.&#34; Haven't yet found out how to actually sync my music.,1
"This is a great app, With the update it will sync your iTunes to your Android, It seems to jumble them up a little bit in order but that is fixable.But more then that they have an amazing Support and response team truly a+",5
Works great and has a tiny but effective footprint on the PC side. Works better than any other solution I have tried for syncing to non-Apple media player or phone. Really awesome.,5
This is the easiest way I have found to sync my itunes music to my Samsung phone and my Kindle Fire.,5
Horrible product.  Does not work as advertised.  Wish I could return it for a refund.  Buyer beware.  Find another product!,1
"I have tried almost every sync app out there for android.  My criteria are that it must sync ratings both ways, work with smart play lists in iTunes, sync play counts, and be user friendly.  I found nothing else even close to this app.  I use the WiFi sync add-on with this. I once had a problem with a non US phone, and the developers fixed the problem immediately.  Very responsive.  Bought it here in Amazon because the other market doesn't work when I travel...  No complaints after almost 1 year.",5
"This is one of the best apps I've purchased through the years. With my new phone, Galaxy Note 2, for some reason I wasn't able to get all my music onto the phone. Many songs would be missing, and it would take forever to transfer the music. I tried several times and finally decided to see if there was a good app out there as I was becoming frustrated.I found iSynr, which I've heard of in the past but didn't feel the need to have. I decided to try it, I use iTunes anyway on my computer. It was amazing! It was fast, transferred all my songs and cover art, and on top of that all my playlists.This is by far one of the best apps I've purchased through the years and well worth the cost. For smooth syncing and music control from computer to phone and back again don't fear wasting your money on this app.",5
"I must admit to HIGH frustration when I first download it and couldn't get it to transfer playlists -- only the songs -- which would have made it useless because you can transfer songs for free without an app with just a USB.  Even restored Kindle to new condition and tried again. Customer service was prompt in responding and suggested I download their (free) music player and use that one instead of Amazon's.  Worked like a charm and now this is JUST what I needed.  Maybe I missed it, but never saw that piece of advice in my installation instructions, so I would recommend they add that so people like me don't get confused (I'm pretty tech savvy too, so if I didn't get it, I'm sure others would benefit from that bit of info!).  Still I'm happy enough to go from 1 star to FIVE stars.  They got it right!",5
"Some say they got it to work and to them I say good for you,but for me no luck at all I would read thru the reviews to see if your particular phone works with it the HTC THUNDERBOLT NO CIGAR",3
This product Allows me to sync up my Kindle and my IPAD easily through my computer. It was easy to install.,5
"I listen to several hours of podcasts each week on my aging iPod Nano 2nd generation plugged into one of my stereo systems. I figured I could save the cost of upgrading to a newer iPod by just copying podcasts from my iTunes library to my new KFHD8.9. I couldn't find any easy way to do this until December 28, 2012 when Amazon featured iSyncr at a discount and so caught my attention. I purchased it and it turned out to be exactly what I needed. I did have to experiment with various settings to finally understand the terminology and to adjust the options to my liking. I prefer syncing over USB because the syncing control panel on the PC is more understandable to me and easier to use than the panel on the KFHD. Now, any time I update my podcasts in iTunes on my desktop PC I am just a few clicks away from having everything synced for listening on my KFHD.",4
I bought this app as it sounded like a way to get some Spanish Lessons on my Kindle Fire HD thru have iTunes.  It was  too complicated in my estimation and discovered another way to achieve the same result without using an app.,3
My husband downloaded all our music from the CD's we sold last year.  Love it.  Try it I think you will be impressed.,5
I tried a different wireless app to load music on my Kindle which was slow and then stopped working.  Using the usb port is much better.,5
"This app wouldn't download my songs to my 16gig SD card reliably, and when it did, it was epic fail. It &lt;&lt;NEVER>> imported all my music even though I checked carefully to ensure I hadn't gone over the level. It may have been something I am doing wrong, but I doubt it. The app asks you where you want the stuff loaded to, then arbitrarily decides where to load the stuff to. Save your time and money. I'm looking for a better solution, and in the meantime, I'm doing this the old-fashioned way. Hey! CDs!",1
Allowed me to get my music out of itunes and onto my kindle with no hassle. I wish this would have came up at the top of the list when I was doing my research.,5
"I have tried to use Songbird, Doubletwist and HTC Sync to sync my music to my HTC Evo. Songbird would take for-ev-er to mount the SD card, Doubletwist recopied all my songs every time and HTC sync took five minutes to update the library and then at least an hour and a half to sync playlists and then copy songs.  I could find no program that seemed to sync as quickly and accurately as iTunes synced my iPod Touch. Now I have.I'm using iSyncr for both my HTC Evo phone and my Acer Iconia tablet. I had trouble with a couple of songs the first couple of times I tried to sync, but once I unchecked those and ran one full sync (about 4500 songs) they synced fine the second time.  Of course the first sync took a long time since the songs had to be copied fully.  What has amazed me is how iSyncr performs on subsequent syncs.  It seems to sync only what has changed and gets the sync over and done with.  I can now sync whenever I want - I don't have to set aside time to make sure the sync happens. I can sync and go - just like iTunes works with my iPod Touch.To the developer:  THANK YOU.",5
"game is super simple, but more difficult than you'd initially think. probably would rate 4 stars, but people are idiots and don't know how to read a description and then rate poorly because of it.",5
This is a cute little game that does exactly what the description says. It's not super complicated but then again I wasn't expecting it to be. This is something fun and cute to occupy your fingers when you need to kill time.,5
"my xoom has a &quot;zoom to fill screen&quot; icon on the bottom of my screen that will make this game fill the screen instead of just the two lines at the top of the screen, so in my case I think this game does have tablet support",4
"Possibly inspired partly by long tap or click and hold gesture of GUIs. Might be nice or menacing, I'm not sure, if popped corn was replaced with new to pop. Something like pop up windows. Or for the paid sequel version 2 which has bread etc levels pop. Anyway got to work out fact that it is just a video game and people can't usually get their minds but so far out of the real life games they make money playing/hosting for others to play. I cared enough to vote. One star is more than zero. The that is my intuition. So I rebel against having to give more stars to rank it higher. An app that gets many votes is more valued or resented than, eh its not the place for this. Ok 2 stars.",2
Don't bother,1
"i like the concept, and the game is as basic as you can get.  i would like to see different boards or popcorn arrangements (maybe make a random piece worth more?  like gold colored, or &quot;buttered&quot;, so if you dont burn it, it is worth extra points) .  other than that, app works fine, no glitches that ive found so far.",4
"Simple idea, cooking popcorn. Incorperates the basics of a touchscreen game. Attractive illustration. Not much to like nor dislike when playing Pop Pop Popcorn.",3
"Not a 5-star game? Correct. Offsetting a 1-star review? Check. This is a very small, very free game. It is fun in its limited way and appropriate for all ages. It could be expanded, as this feels more like a prototype, but its cute.",5
"kids love trying to  pop the corn without burning any of the others.  teaches timing and hand & eye coordination.  meanwhile, they don't know they're learning anything al all.  ha ha, jokes on them!  Maybe I should get this for my husband, hmmmmmm.",5
"a short,  cute simple game that my. younger cousins and nephew love. the app description doesn't try to make the app seem like some it is not; it is a shallow time waster for kids and adults alike.",5
"Dumb, uninstalled. Probably the fastest I have uninstalled an app after downloading. I definitively do not recommend. If the graphics were better it could have some use. Don't bother...",1
"I love it.  Good clean fun that kept my kids entertained on a camping trip  zThey though your popping shoulf get a score...  charcoal being the worst insult, while utter perfection on the high end.",4
"I admit this wouldn't hold my attention for long. But my kids ages 2-6 really like it.My two year old could care less  if she ""burns"" the kernels, she likes pressing the kernels to see and hear them pop. such cute graphics too",5
"You press on kernels to pop them, then you refresh the screen to do it all over, sort of like a bubble wrap app.  Quickly got bored with it and uninstalled.",2
"I took advantage of the free price on this app and thought it would be something to have on hand when I was bored. Although I could see a kid having some fun with it, it did not entertain an adult for more than a few seconds. Nothing wrong with the app just not for me. Worked on 3.1, 3.2, 2.2 and 2.3 well with no crashes.",4
Don't bother with this app. I wish I could delete it from my purchased app history so I'm not reminded that it was ever on my phone. I should have known better.,1
I'm just not feeling it with this app. I guess I burned like 10 seconds before I got annoyed. That popcorn burns as easily as your average sensitive explosive.,3
"rather boring, I don't see the point in the game,  you just place finger on kernels till pop.if more to it, then instructions lacking",1
This is a awesome kids game... Adults mentioning its more for kids and rating it low is ridiculous! Adoy its in the name pop pop popcorn I mean do you really think it would be for adults? Makes me wonder about ya'llAnyway Fantastic for my 4 yr old daughter!!,5
It is hard for me to raise the volume on the UI. I can only raise the volume bar to the second to the last bar. I also wish there was a way to have more options in the free version like lower quality songs.,4
"This is a cool app. It gives you fm stations from around the world. You cant really search a song but with the number of stations you have, you always find a station just for you.",4
I like the fact that you have so many stations to choose from and the playback feature. I wish that they had an option that allows you to store your tagged songs so that you can listen to them later.,4
"Although I have only had this app a short time, I find it to be quite user friendly. It has superior audio quality and in my opinion is a delightful alternative to Pandora. Additionally, the app overview video was also, well done.",5
"I have anther brand of streamer for my iPhone, and it is similar. I did notice that this product under the talk category lists only liberal leaning talk shows. The other product has more categories under talk including liberal and conservative.",3
"music app and stuff like that no cell phone call out reminders for shows, clear audio, static free, search works, play and stop work.",5
"The XiiaLive is a reasonably good basic radio with access to different formats of music.  For free it is OK.  I would want a better, bigger selection of formats if I were paying for it.  On the internet, there are several more complete radio sites. I haven't tried to visit them on the Kindle Fire yet.",4
Easy to use. Lovely to hear. Nice selection of stations from all over the world.  Able to easily save fave stations and songs.,5
"The quality of the audio is excellent - selection process is impossible.Can't figure out how to turn off the station that is streaming. Can't figure out how to search for particular radio stations - the station call letters do not produce the desired station. Lists of stations, songs etc. not in alphabetical or numeric order. Profuse disorganization!Very unfriendly user interface - at least for this attempting user. No apparent help available explaining how to maneuver the app. I give up!",1
"Alot more apps have been release of late, but this was one of the first radio apps that I got to pick up international or US based internet radio stations. I wish the search option was better.  Maybe if hashtags were incorporated, it would help.  I don't like the fact that you have to pay for that.  The free version does the trick if you know what you are looking for.  Otherwise you might get a bunch of stations that you need to listen through before you get to what you really want.  The buffering is a bit bad.  I'd get alot of dropped signals when listening to stations in the gym.  Not sure if that is an app issue or the station stream.",3
there a better streaming apps out there like Tune in Radio &amp; Raditaz. this app has some unique qualities but a major draw back (for me) is the boing boing sound when you adjust the volume. I'm sure there are other pros &amp; cons but I utilize the aforementioned apps the most.,3
I uninstalled this software and found an alternative to stream shout cast networks. This one take a lot of resources.,1
"If you want an app that streams thousands of internet radio stations from around the works with every possible genre, this is the app for you.i love this app.  I stream internet radio A LOT and have tried lots of other from both amazon and the android store, THIS ONE IS THE BEST AND IT&apos;S FREE!",5
Not worth it does not let you listen to what you would like to and you can not pick what you would like,1
great variety of stations.. easy to find what your looking for.. easy to navigate.. what more could you ask for..,5
This app works great. Tons of station to choose from. Anything you like is there. Great alarm clock and sleep functions. I would say this is the best radio app I have seen so far.,5
"I got the paid version when it was FAOTD. Have since installed the free version on everything else in the house that speaks Android. if you want commercialless music or talk of any kind, get this app.Aside from the dark gray on black printing which is really hard to decipher in some places and the equalizer not. working on some devices and a fairly steep learning curve this is a great app. free or paid. Get it.",5
good game over all it is hard to get the updates to happen. the computer always seems to win. i loved this game as a child and i still do.,3
This is a lot easier than the board game where you can lose the rocks. Mancala is a great counting game for kids. You can change the starting pebbles and speed.  My seven year old loves to play this game with us or against the computer.,4
It's an okay game to play but after a period of time it does get boring. Doesn't really present any challenges to keep me interested for the long run. But is ok for now,3
It take the marbles from ur goal I hate it its SO un fair. TGIF aka thank God it's FREE don't buy take my advice and don't download,1
"It was nice to play since I knew the rules.  Otherwise, I would have quit.  Also the stones moved pretty quickly.  Wish there were a fast/slow speed.",3
"The game&quot;runs&quot;, but it doesnt play the rules of thegame correctly.  Simple moves that should give me or the computer points just simply dont work.  Geeze, at least know the rules of a game when you make an app for it.  Deleted in under 1 minute.",1
"This is a time waster. I am really disappointed. This app is slow. And, the picture looks like it would be for a baby. I love mancala, but I'm extremely sad. Don't waste your time with this app.",1
"my son and I play a few games of mancala here and there. Well, I have no idea where our mancala wooden game went so I bought this. Works great. We like it.",5
"Somewhat boring.  Tried different number of stones but it still gets old fast.  Once you figure out where to start, the challenge is mostly over.",3
I used to play this game all the time as a kid. great to see an app for it! And it's free to boot! :),5
I loved playing this as a kid! I love playing against the computer! I love taking it on the go!,5
Like saying this game even though I never seem to win.  LOL.  I can hardly wait to play it with other people,5
"This games has been around for a long, long time.  But playing this on your Kindle is better!  You don't lose the &#34;pieces&#34;...you don't have to carry around the &#34;board&#34;, and you get good instructions, and a nice pace to enjoy as well! Bravo to Xoise Solutions, Inc.!",4
"the response time is very slow when you make a move.  I have the Mancala board game at home, nothing is quite like the real thing.",2
Good game over all it is hard to get updates to happen. The computer always seems to win and after a while it is boring.,3
"It doesn't cheat.  Play is fine. But the graphics aren't the best and the AI makes the same beginning moves every game. Even still, the game is fun.",3
"Not the most difficult Mancala programs. Lots of fun as a pastime. It's free, so you really can't go wrong.",5
This game can be played against the computer or another person. Just a simple counting game just like it really is.,5
"I enjoy this game, but it's too smal on my tablet.  I still play it because it's a fun game.. and the tablet is small for any purpose and/or location.  If it was bigger on the screen, I'd give it a 5 star.",4
It didn't play the game correctly it was totally different my  turn only lasted one play when it was supposed to lastlike 5,2
this game is awesome and I have the game and I know a very huge secret to this game it's when u get to keep on playing on and on so the next player doesn't get to go but I will never tell now I'm doing the evil laugh bye and u better get this game or else (:,5
Works great. Plays just like you were playing with another person. I have always loved this game growing up. Now I can play anytime.,5
"I love the game Mancala but can't find good apps for the game.  This one would be great if there were template options and it would stop freezing.  I play as a single player and if the game wants the computer to go first it freezes.  I have to close the game out and restart it several times so that the player goes first, when the player goes first the game doesn't freeze.03/05/13A recent app update by developer has RESOLVED the freezing issue, so I have changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars.",4
This is my daughter and sons favorite new game to play together. My 4 yr old does not even realize he is learning some math concepts. We love playing this to just pass the time.,5
the mancala app game was not what i expected because it is small and ineffective. Not worth it at all.,1
Have not played this since my childhood days. Did have a real board and we used marbles or small shells. Great game and easy to learn.,4
"I just learned to play this game, the app is helpful for learning strategy, but it is fairly easy to win. a little more challenge would earn this app five stars",4
This is one of the few apps that work on the first generation fire. I've always loved this game. I'm glad I can play it on my fire.,5
"I love the clean look of the board. Great strategy game from Africa.  Action is fast, no hesitation.  It can be an addicting game.",5
"Great game, and an adequate app if you know how to play. Some of the graphic coding isn't done that well, such as marbles landing in adjacent slots. Good number system to keep track of play even if the graphics aren't great.",3
I like this board game.However it is easier to play the board game.My kids and I just couldn't get the hang of this particular game's electronic version.,3
"This game, and most games for that matter, don't need access to accounts!  Come on, give me a break.  And I was so looking forward to playing - oh well, I'll recover, but recovery would be hard if I let my tablet's account information become compromised, just for a game.",1
this app wasn't really good because you don't know when its your turn and then you get confused and frustrated,2
"twenty, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, i dont know what to say, but ive got 8 more words to write",5
"I tend to use either Pandora or TuneIn for music.  Xiia quickly became one of my favorite apps. Streaming is very fast and has a very good selection of stations to choose from.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I cannot change the color of the controls. The lettering is to dark. Otherwise,  this is a keeper.",4
This app is offers a wide selection of radio stations all over the world.  I like it.  It is easy to use.  You can be entertained by many different kinds of music.,5
"Does what I want it to do, easy to use, sorts be genre, wide range of available stations. Even includes international content. Like it very much.  ,",5
"I really like this app because of really nice interface, and unlike others, it has a sleep timer and alarm. This, and spotify, are about the only online music apps i use anymore(goodbye pandora). Just a few features, that i've been looking for, is all it took. Great job!",5
The best radio app I have found so far. Still looking but the best so far. Still finding new stations daily...,4
"When reading on the Kindle Fire, I like listening to music. A lot of times classical music works best. Iheartradio only has two stations. This app offers entire stations that specialize in classical guitar or Baroque or whatever. I got it for free and don't have to give any info out. Awesome!",5
"I can say that this is one of the best radio apps that I've used.  There are tons of different radio stations for your listening pleasure.  You are guaranteed to find something that you like. It's a quality app that I have had no issues with. Also, If you're worried about permissions, just email the developer or go to their website.  The developer is very responsive, which is rare sometimes, with other developers.  Also those sticky intents permissiosn is not only on this app, it's on other apps as well - especially apps that have an alarm function, such as this one.  At $4, this app is a deal. Pandora is $36 per year (with no ads).",5
I love being able to save a song to the app and go back later and be able to get the title info so I can go purchase the song.,5
This is a great app if you like to stream internet radio. It has worked well. Many ways to search for what you want to listen for. Sound quality is good and clear.,4
"I was told about this app by my daughter who found her favorite Christian radio station right away. While mine wasnt available, I could listen to hers and while my favorite classical station was not available either, a short seach by Classical genre gave me several good choices as well as one with NO commercials (at least not so far). This is really a good app for my Kindle as I really enjoy listening to clasical music while reading and even while playing games.",4
"I couldn't be more pleased, so many stations to choose from (including several pagan stations), with an easy to use interface.",5
"I like the interface.  It makes getting to shoutcast stations much easier. I'm glad I got it as a FAOTD, I don't know if I'd have paid for it since I have Pandora and Slacker.",4
"For what it's worth, this is a pretty awesome radio app. There are over 50,000 radio stations of multiple genres to surf through, and I think that number will only grow. I actually hope it does, for likeTuneIn Radio Prothere are a lot of local stations that I do not have access to, so for the momentiHeartRadiois the only one that I can listen to all local, and even some elsewhere that is ineligible for me onXiiaLive Proor TuneIn.The interface is a breeze to get through and to get used to. You can search songs, you can favorite songs; you can even tag songs, which is something that I haven't seen before. Overall, the app alone is pretty good. I just hope it gets improved by making more stations readily available.",4
I can finally listen to a radio station that I haven't been able to in years. Shins like my regular radio.,4
Downloaded to my RAZR Maxx HD. Seems to work but have other similar apps that are much better. Already uninstalled.,1
"Got this as free app of the day through the Amazon app market, and it is not too excellent, but then again I got it for free so cannot really be too upset.",2
Works fine for me. Lots of different stations. I don't understand why people think their phone and every app is out to get them. Read the reviews on Google Play.,4
"It's very similar to Pandora. Got it as the free app of the day. These people going insane over permissions is just stupid.  No one is making you install the app, you whiney f'in nerds. Just don't use it. Simple as that. Pathetic.",4
This is a joke compared to Pandora.if I could I would give it no stars.stop trying to be different and just download Pandora.who u got to impress?,1
great selection and very ewasy to use.  I would recommend this app to anyone.  easy to keep track of favorite stations,5
Got this as a FAOTD and would have gladly paid for it!  Really have enjoyed this music app. Love the 80's and it had everything and then some!!!  Very pleased!,5
This radio  is really great in listening lots of great choice from around the world. Easily going from one station to another with just a click of a stroke. From old favorites to up to the minute hits not only here in the US but all over the world.,5
"Have nexus 10 and galaxy s2 phone. With the phone, this crashes my clocks alarm in the morning.  With the nexus, the audio skips badly when another process takes place, like when I click on something that needs the processor, xiaa doesn't like it.  Will uninstall.",1
"Have had no problems with this app.  Nice interface took a bit of getting used to but good, and quick to tune the stations.  Works well on 4g.",4
I can listen to the old time radio shows I enjoy so much. My only suggestion is that more be made available. But since I love the old detective and crime dramas I am content,5
"xiialive is a great player for SHOUTcast streams.When I searched the GENRE section, I immediately found a great station that I'd never heard of before.The equalizer works pretty well on my Kindle HD7. I use a CUSTOM setting.It does have a couple of desirable features that are not easy to find, if you don't hold it right.Bitrate selection requires holding my tablet in portrait orientation and looking for the android-standard menu on the pull-down buttons.It is not Pandora and it isn't RealPlayer, so there are several internet radio sources that it can't play, but that doesn't mean it is the worst player out there.It just means that it won't play streams that aren't SHOUTcast streams, duh.And I finally found out how to close the player.Press the STOP button, first, and then exit the app with the BACK arrow.",5
"I could easily use this as an alternative to &quot;tune in radio pro&quot;, it's actually more complete as it has presets and it's own volume rocker that overrides the phone's one. It comes with 3 visual themes and also a lot of customization through the settings. Thanks Amazon, great FAOTD choice!",5
"I've been using tune in radio pro for a while now, and love that.  I don't think that this has the ability to record music, but there are tons of music genre's, tons of stations and the user interface is very user friendly.  Awesome faotd, so thank you for it.",5
The app works well and is &#34;behaved&#34;... no pop-up surprises or junk. If you like music that is slightly out of the box... this is your app.,5
"Great app for streaming music.  I really like the search function where you can search by artist or song or you can find stations by genre.  I love that it even has movie soundtracks and anime stations. Favorite-ing stations is very simple, loading is quick, and the history tracker is very useful.",5
"UI is very refined and easily usable.  There are so many channels that it's going to take a long time to listen to them all.  Plenty of choices for everyone.The audio queues for connection and disconnection are nice when you don't have the screen on and wonder why your music stopped playing.  Doesn't seem related to the application at all because some of the channels were flawless and others disconnected quite a bit.  (Mostly those from across the world like Ukraine).Good app, thanks for picking a good one this time Amazon.",5
get this app! its amazing. so many different genres. I can listen to The stations all day! you wont regret it plus its free!,5
"Don't much about all the flap about the permissions, but this one does not push a bunch of adds like some radio apps or freeze up like others I have tried.",4
a great way to explore a plethora of radio medium.  this app is a terrific addition to any. tablet.  I heartily recommend it,4
Another good reason for the FAOTD. I had idea this app was around. Will be a great way to reconnect with shout cast. Well designed with many options.,4
I love this app AND got it when it was free! Would still be worth the 4 bucks! Get it!,4
I like this app a lot! Great radio station you just pick a station and go about your business. You can pick your station by genres or decades. I must admit I've only listened to the 30-40 swing station since I got this app. I love it :),5
"This is the best music app!! The station's are great and my being a fan of music from the 60's and 70's, it has the best station's!!",5
I just got this today and haven't stopped listening to it! I really like it! I cannot see any thing wrong with it.hope you like it too,5
"I give this  app, a very big high five.it gives me every kind of music from native American music to hip hop,to country it has everything you need.",5
This program is outstanding.  I like music and got this so I can hear Music as I use my tablet.  I just typed Japan in the search feature (No reason I could have type Ethiopia but I was not sure of the spelling!) and a list of Japanese listening language) channels appeared.  I selected one and BAM (Like the Chef!) Japanese music started to play like I was there on the Island of Fukuoka in the city of Saga.  I wonder what they were saying during the commercials?  I highly recommend this program.,5
"An internet radio app doesnt need to run at startup, and &quot;send sticky broadcasts&quot; has been documented by an Android OS developer as something he regrets was made public.Do a Google search on these words to read his comments: regretting sticky broadcast public",1
"Out of all of the internet streaming apps out there, this is the one that's not only a great fit for me, but also performs great.  you see, I was spoiled by Pocket Tunes, an app I had on my old Palm os PDA, and my internet streaming app quest for Android had to include certain features.  I had to have a sleep timer, I had to be able to add and modify an assortment of streams, had to play in the background, not a memory hog, good customer support, active program updates.  That shouldn't be too hard to find, those things, it is.  XiiaLive matches beautifully.Not only did I get what I needed, but also some really cool features I hadn't even thought of like the little alert sounds, which are extremely informative in the dark.  I listen to audio streams while nodding off to sleep so when it has to buffer or I drop connection, I don't have to physically look to see what happened.  I very rarely drop connection, but when I reconnect, I love the ball drop sound upon connection.I'm sure this app does more than I'm telling you, but for me, this is the best one and I'm picky.",5
I love this app. It's got lots of stations to choose from. Knave been using it for years and glad the updates have been a great UI improvement.,4
"It's an all right radio player, and there are several out there to try. I tried several radio stations and all of them came in clearly, no problem. I do wish the controls were a little more intuitive, especially when looking for a station. I had to really dig just to find Top 40, which is what I listen to most... as do most people. Also, I wish I could search by location as I'd rather listen to something local or from a specific country. No major complaints, but nothing about this blew me away either. If you are looking for Internet radio, try the trial first before dropping upwards of five dollars on this.",3
the best app for music yet. the sleep timer and wake up feature is better than any alarm clock. thank you amazon.,5
"hee, hee, hee...listening to instrumental right now...fabulous!  Even has a graphic equalizer with bass boost.  Thanks for making this app free.  I am a cheapscape, and free is always a welcome choice!  Great christian stations complete with sermon and teaching broadcasts...",5
This application is much more than any other. It's like having the best long wave/short wave right in your Android device. Works well under any circumstances. Bravo for this keeper!,5
"Love the OTR, and the selections within each genre. I like that the current program is shown on the link so you can see what you are clicking into",5
I love this app. It works perfect for playing country music. The only this is you need to have Wi-Fi to use it and sometimes. It stops randomly. Variety of modern songs too.(:,4
I loaded this app on a dual boot HP Touch pad. My husband and I really enjoy listening to the Christian instrumental stations. This app works great with no complaints so far.,5
Had it for a few weeks now......No problems....... good variety of stations..... I listen to Christmas year round..... plus old time radio horror and mystery shows.  Easy to use search function...... Keeps a list of my favorites.,4
"I've DL a few of these, but this one is the best - give it a go, you won't regret it.",5
"I'm not much for internet radio, but a free one that give you TONS of options?  Pretty awesome!  Thanks for making it free Amazon!",5
"Great look, easy of use. Nice coverage, lots of stations and awesome variety. But, why such apps ask for too many permissions? This should be regulated. Lets see.",3
"Best radio app! Was wonderful on my phone, works beautifully on my tablet as well.Very large selection of Christian stations, which is sooo hard to find on most apps (sadly). Feature PACKED! Has customizable sleep timer, alarms to wake to any station, favorites, backup, bluetooth, search...and on and on. Can't find any flaws, nothing missing here! Got as a FAOTD, but one of the select few really worth paying for. Nice UI as well. If  you're looking for an all-around radio app, this is it!",5
This seems to be a really good app. Works great on galaxy lll. easy to use. haven't found anything bad about it yet.,5
"* Note: This is an Internet radio app. You will not find your local radio stations. This is clearly stated in the description *XiiaLive is a fabulous app. I like the variety of options you're given. You can view your history, tag songs you'd like to remember, set alarms, change the theme, even scan stations.The interface is clean and it offers alternatives when I'm tired of listening to the same songs on my Mp3 player and the radio.One feature I appreciate about TuneIn that this app doesn't have is the ability to easily search using city and state. XiiaLive's results are shown as one long, random list, no categorizing or in any kind of order. And you have to type in the call letters / city yourself instead of conveniently choosing from a list.There is also no way to easily access the app. Instead of being able to simply swipe down the menu and see song info, you have to go all the way into the app from the homepage. Major design flaw and major annoyance.That being said, I've discovered some great online radio stations and new music. I dig this app and recommend it.",4
"I'd heard of this program from several friends who swear by it (and a few who swear at it :D ), so I figured I'd pick it up. Haven't yet used it.",4
This is a great app and works great on my fire.  I recommend it highly.  I have had no problems with it at all.,5
I love Shoutcast and the integration of it into this app is awesome! This app is highly recommended for music lovers!!,5
"I'm still very new to the whole e-anything. This popped up on the free app of the day, so I grabbed it. Right off the bat I played with it for a few minutes till I got a handle on how to maneuver. I made the kids laugh when I put the ear buds in my ears and danced to Celtic music around the house with my Kindle Fire stuck in my back waste-band.  Huge choice of streaming music from every genre from around the world. Since it was one of my new experiences in the e-music or streaming music, I'm hooked. Get this app, YES, recommended. .",5
it is great to have easy listening to enhance the routine!  great selection of music to sooth the soul. loving the breeze.,5
Let's you listen to all kinds of internet radio right on your Kindle without having to enable web to go to the stations.  NICE!,4
I love this app!! It plays great music from all over and you choose the genre and radio station that you want to hear. It is far better than Pandora and Slacker and plays more variety than Songza! Thanks Amazon!!,5
"This is my favorite Internet radio app that I have on my kindle! Very easy to navigate, equalizer feature works great, and they have a huge selection of world wide stations! I have had none of the previous issues stated in the other reviews. I would HIGHLY recommend this app for people who are seriously tired of the songza or Pandora loop.",5
"I down loaded this app when it was free.  I thought I would use it.  However, I did not.  Wasn't my thing and I couldn't figure it out.  I deleted it.",2
"Best streaming radio app ever.  Better than IHeart, Pandora, and even Jango, my previous favorite.  As a Baby Boomer, I can't stand current music and only listen to the music I grew up with. I love the station selection on XiiaLive Pro. It works great on Kindle Fire.  My fave station is Fun 45's.com. If you were born in the 50's,  you'll love it too. Well worth the price.  No adds, no commercials, no problems at all, just great music.",5
this is very good radio app but the only issue I have is how do you close it? if I could close the app I would give it 5 star,4
"Quality sound, easy to find music can be sorted by artist, genre, or song title.  Each genre seems to have a good variety of stations to choose from.  It is also easy to switch from station!  It is easy to use and you can leave it turned on while you switch to reading a book or a magazine.  This offers every type of music from classical to country.  There is nothing about this app that I did not like.This is one of my favorite apps.",5
This is one of my two favorite radio streaming apps. It works great and never crashes on me and u use it every day. It does a great job of keeping the stream playing.,5
"This app is okay. I've only listened to a couple of stations and they're not quite what I expected, especially for a paid app.I tried the Irish Pub station and was really expecting more pub like music. Not everything I listened to was really what I would define as &quot;pub&quot; music, which I would define as something you'd hear at an Irish session.I also tried the Wacken station because I thought it'd have a decent selection of heavy metal. I haven't had time to listen it a lot, but I thought the Pogues was an interesting choice for a metal channel.Anyways, these seem like random Internet channels and I'm entirely convinced that all of them are good. Maybe it's just what I'm into. I'll play around with it more and see where it ends up.",3
"Not a very bad app, but not the best. I recommend TuneIn app which has better function to find local stations, (the TuneIn app made this easy). This app did not have as comprehensive catagory functions. Display of radio stations did not always display the station's logo, which makes quick selection more of a chllenge. I did not pay for this app, I got it with the free app of the day from Amazon, I would not pay for it, there are better apps such as TuneIn to go with.",2
A bit of a challenge to start but didn't take long to find the stations I wanted.  I like Celtic and they have a nice mix.  Something for everyone,5
"I got this for the free app of the day since it had Shoutcast capabillities. It's smooth, awesome and works well. I recommend it. There are free radio apps that are good, too, but this one seems to run more smoothly and you actually get Shoutcast stations, which are hard to find free like this on Android. Not that this is free now.I like how the search feature searches songs that the stations are playing instead of the station name, but it would be nice if I could search the station name, too.",5
"I had no problems getting the music to play.  My problem was finding the &#34;settings&#34; for the volume control, as well as, how to shut it off!",3
"I am a huge fan of music but generally I prefer to listen to music on my device or through Pandora, however I decided to give this app a chance a a truly enjoy it. Most of the music apps that I have downloaded in the past have not lived up to my expectations however this app has truly amazed me that it allows me to listen to my favorite bands and songs. I especially love being able to tag my favorite songs and saving my favorite stations. This is a great app.",4
Nice little android web radio app. Unfortunately it is competing with Pandora which is the Cadillac of web radio apps.,4
"I liked it right after I downloaded it. I liked it when I was playing around with it. Easy to use and maneuver. Had problems connecting to a lot of stations. Had problems triong to figure out how to stop it and exit out of the app completely. I just ended up pausing it ans leaving it paused, until the middle of the night. It unpaused and scared me half to death, beings it was close to my head. I paused again and set it down. It unpaused once more. I, then, decided to uninstall  it. Thanks, but no thanks.",2
"This thing plays internet radio stations, not real radio stations. They should say that up front. No use to me, glad it was free.",1
"Had to uninstall after it started trying to view every file type I downloaded, including ePub, PDF, and others. That seems a bit overkill to me...",2
"App and reviews sounded great, esp. for free, but it never worked for me.  I downloaded it twice, uninstalling in between and rebooting phone, and still kept getting the weird 'ball bouncing on hard floor' sound and 'Android Media console died' message no matter what radio station I tried.  I got one to stream for a few seconds but it kept losing the connection and going on and off.  I'm on Verizon 4G with a very strong signal. so it's just an app that won't work for me.",1
Nice radio ap .Easy to use.I like it.Its better than someof the other radio aps that I have tried in the past.,5
"This is a solid Internet radio app. As many before me have said, this has a very similar feature set to much of the other radio apps already on the market.That said, some of the fine details impress me here. On this,or any other music app, I rarely see any comments regarding bit rate&hellip; Which makes me wonder if I am the only person with a mobile data-cap??? This app has a wonderful feature where when you search or browse stations you can filter by a certain bit rate of your choosing. For those of us with a data limit, this is amazingly useful. While I really like listening to Internet radio, I have no intention of using all of my mobile data in a short few days.Other nice features I didn't find elsewhere include a history of songs listened and the ability to tag a song for later viewing. This is wonderfully useful if you want to download the song from Amazonmp3 later on (when you get to a PC or within wifi?).Unfortunately, I do not see any local radio stations herein, nor any specific feature to pull up your local radio stations based on location, etc.. This is one feature I really like about TuneIn radio.All in all, a good app. Hopefully they continue to improve it, listening to feedback from users, and in the end make it a great music app.",4
"It connects you to streaming websites.  I like Pandora for finding new artists, but you can get similar results from the stations here.  Reminds me of the &quot;radio&quot; tab inWindows Media Player 10.",4
actually &quot;Kay&quot; it in fact says &quot;find your favorite local radio stations&quot;. not sure what description you read. you might want to re-read something before you try to quote it.,1
"I downloaded Xiia as FAOTD and was immediately hooked.I don't know what some people here are talking about permissions.I doubt Xiia has something evil in mind.I tested the program by entering the name of the German band Kraftwerk - not one of the most popular bands right now.Sure enough, Kraftwerk`s &quot;tour de france&quot; appeared.No matter what I threw at it after that, Xiia delivered.A very versatile app and well worth the money it costs now.",5
"Love the look, love the stations, love the breakdown, love the categories!  Highly recommended.  Who needs satellite radio when you've got XiiaLive Pro?  Buy once and get rid of monthly subscriptions.",5
"At first I was a little skeptical, because I got it free from Amazon. But it really works great. Much better than others I've tried.",4
I downloaded this free app onto my Fire HD.  It works well.  But there are better applications for music.  And yes the better app is probablly the one you are thinking of -- ask anyone under the age of 30 something and they weill tell you what it is.,3
This app was free yesterday! A big break from the kiddy games. Best stream player I have ever seen. Definitely worth the 2.99 their asking. Just added to my favorites. Enjoy Your Kindle!,5
"I enjoy streaming music so decided to give XiiaLive Pro a shot.  Unfortunately, the app just isn't very good. There are other music apps that offer more.",2
"I haven't tried everything on it yet, but I have certainly liked what I've seen so far.  The in app sounds are not annoying, yet adequetly announce what is happening.",4
"This app functions and looks wonderful. It has a wide variety of different types of music to choose from and everything starts up quick. It also follows the holo style guidelines set forth by android, which looks wonderful and makes the app look like it just belongs. Also, it sounds clearer than slacker and I like listening to the great stations from the big cities and international radio stations.",5
This is another solid internet radio app with a gorgeous interface. My favorite radio apps are iHeart and Tunein for local radio. Xiialive has a wider variety of radio stations not found on either iHeart or Tunein. I searched for some of my favorite local stations I use in the other 2 apps and they are not available in xiialive.So instead of using xiialive to replace the other 2 which is what I had hoped it looks like it will compliment the other two apps.UPDATE: This is the FASTEST radio internet app I have used. I don't know how the devs did it but unlike the other internet radio apps you usually have to deal with the connection first then the buffering of the audio. With xiialive I have NOT encountered any buffering or connection issues. Playback is nearly instantaneous. I tried it from a range of radio stations from around the world including different genres and as soon as I selected the station the audio appeared.,4
"Just when you think Amazon is gonna give us another kids game, they pull this sweet surprise. I checked play store and reviews were not false here. The Internet radio app I was waiting for, works perfectly on Samsung galaxy SII and Note 10.1, thanks Amazon!",5
"This is now my preferred music app. Yes, it's that nice! Jeez I'm getting tired of typing just to hit the stupid minimum.",5
"Being the App of the day I thought it couldn't hurt to try.  Like another user, apps started to crash. I have a Note ll and everything was running smooth and fine. I removed it last week and now my Note is back to normal.  Bottom line, stay away.",1
I miss having my streaming on my phone and have not had it for a while due to always having issues and the apps not working right.  I decided to give another program a try and ran into XiiaLive; best thing ever!  Works great and never have any problems.  Thanks for the hard work guys and gals!,5
"pretty good for what you pay. easy to use, lots of stations to chsoose from, and looks pretty cool. I love it.",5
I tried using this the other night and it would not work.  All the other apps I have used to watch videos work ok.,1
Just have a hard time deciding which station to listen to the most!!! Love all the gospel music  options since that is my preference and the Lord is being Glorified in it. Thank you all for sharing the gospel WORD!,5
"I love this app. Easy to use, runs in the background, lots of music stations to chose from. I am very pleased I made this purchase.",5
"I mainly listen to my own .mp3s on my Fire but for those times when I want something different, this app does the trick for me.  It has enough selections in the categories that interest me to meet my needs.I have not experienced any issues with it on my Kindle Fire HD.",5
"Pandora, That is all that I can say but I have to have more word to meet the min. requirement to submit a review :-)",1
"this app was ok at first then even when my kindle is turned off it went on when I tried to turn it off it would not work, thus I had no option but to delete it.",1
"Keeps telling me that I need internet access then immediately exits. My 4G LTE connection is FINE. That, plus the stupid permissions mentioned, motivates me to uninstall and enjoy tune in pro, which also allows recording and has multiple timer settings.",1
This app far better than winamp.  This is more stape and alot easier to use.  Great app.  I highly reccomend.,5
This app is primarily intended to advise those who are from outside the USA that his/her home station may be available using this app.,4
Can't understand why people are rating this so poorly . It has a nice ui and is extremely user friendly . It even has a alarm clock. I love this. It may even replace two or three of my music apps. So get this while you can for free and appreciate it. Thank you amazon for giving us apps that we can sometimes use.,5
"Thanks Amazon for making this app free today, but it's not worth it. I was intrigued by the equalizer, but you really can't tell THAT much of a difference on the Samsung Epic. The streaming is choppy (cuts out every 5-10 sec), and the app slows down other apps, e.g. words lag when typing on Tweetcaster.I also am confused and perhaps somewhat overwhelmed by what station to choose. The stations listed are the actual station names but don't really have a good description. You just have to assume the stations will play within the genre. I definitely prefer Pandora, which plays the next song based on songs you like and stays within the genre (or you can create your own station). The streaming on Pandora also isn't choppy. Maybe others have had better luck with this app, but I've already uninstalled it from my phone.",2
"I am very impressed with the interface of this app.  Makes finding new music an easy experience.  It is a bit higher priced than TuneIn Radio, but I think it is well worth it.  I'm still exploring around with it, so I may update with some criticism later.  For now, it is my go-to music app.",4
"Why does a music app need so much access to the data (including protected data) on my phone? Beware of &quot;Sticky Notes&quot; That software gives the developer access to your data at any time and as a many times as they need. Also, why does it need to be on &quot;start up&quot;?",1
"1) malicious intent because a sticky broadcast will blow by any other security and be global to the entire system. So they can easily be used for very nefarious reasons. 2) lazy programming. 3) some valid reason for some system level application that you truly truly trust that actually would need such access (I cannot think of a single example of a user level application that would need this level of access).Unexplained sticky intents in a radio app are EXTREMELY suspicious. They are global and they stick around forever. They also blow past all other permissions and security since they are intended to be used at the SYSTEM level only. No radio app ever needs that level of access! Ever ever ever! Sorry, but no way in heck will I install this and I will definitely warn people about it. I did ""buy it"" as the free app of the day but when I noticed the permissions I did not actually install it and I will not as long as they have these ridiculous permissions embedded in it. Shame on this developer for trying to pull a fast one (or so it seems).In fact, here is a direct quote from a developer of Android itself: "" Er... there is NO reason to use sticky broadcasts for communication within your own app. In fact, I'll go farther and say you just should not do this. Sticky broadcasts are GLOBAL to the system. And because of this, performing a sticky broadcast is multiple orders of magnitude slower than just implementing direct calls within your own app (IPC for each receiver to register, IPC to the system to send it, IPC from the system back to your app to deliver it, marshalling and unmarshalling of all the data within the Intent over both IPCs).More than that, there is NO protection on them, so any other application can watch your sticky broadcasts, or even send their own values back to you. (Btw, this is also issue with using any broadcasts within your own app. Broadcasts are really there for cross-application communication. It is just far more efficient and easier to implement these things within an app by having a callback interface.)Now I am really regretting that I made that function public. :/> And of course, if you want out of application notifications, you have > no other option.You do have the option of using a normal broadcast rather than a sticky broadcast. You'll notice that there are basically no sticky broadcasts used by the system, at least that you see in the public APIs. In fact there are some places they are used internally, but even those are slowly going away as we discover security holes with them because there is no way to protect who can receive the broadcast data.""If you Google a block of this post you will find the original source Amazon will not allow me to post a link to it. (Update you can find the link to this in Daniel's comment, below! Turns out that links seem to be okay in replies, just not in reviews? At least it wouldn't allow me to do it. No matter, it's there.)",1
"Interface is a little in the bland side, but the extreme usability and nearly no buffering makes this a keeper for me. Very straightforward workings and really nothing speak ill of.",5
I've tried several of these apps and I really like Xiialive the best! Works great on my Samsung Galaxy S4.,5
"I imagine this app is going through some growing pains. Maybe I will try it again in a year or so, but right off the bat it did not connect to the first three music genre choices that I selected. Then, when it locked in on to what I was hoping to be an acoustic blues station, I ended up getting a Pointer Sisters song. My next attempt got me some sort of techno/rave dance beat. I am pretty sure that is not even close to Chicago Blues.",2
"This is a decent app. lots of different genres that I like that are not in other apps out there. not very graphical but hey, it works. glad I got it as a free app of the day. I wouldn't pay $3.99 for this.",5
"I'm a huge music and radio streamer. I have 4 apps I already use for varying proposes being Pandora, Grooveshark, TuneIn and 8 Tracks. This app is particularly well built and functions rather well. It's got a great UI and it's easy to understand. There's plenty of stations to listen to. Found local and international stations I'm already a fan of. All that said this app simply doesn't bring anything to the table that I don't already have the ability to do and doesn't pack enough to replace any of the apps I have. I'd recommend any of the 4 aforementioned apps before recommending this one but this is one solid app in it's own right. 4 stars!",4
"Very enjoyable app.  Have listened to it for a few months before giving it a review.  As the days have progressed, it has gradually replaced my shortwave and hd radios with more stations to choose from and no need to play the antenna dance.Works great on the k-fire original.  Can run all day if the battery is fully charged.  I find new, enjoyable, unexpected stations almost every day.  Good sound.The only problem occurs when I fastforward too quickly through my list of saved stations.  The programme freezes.  Just restart your device and remember to wait until the station is fully buffered before moving to another channel and you'll be back to business as usual.Well worth the purchase price.  Give it a try.",5
I have been using this application daily. It works great for listening to my favorite National Public Radio broadcasts via the west coast. The sound quality in the music broadcast from the 80s channel is not top notch. The music sounds like all the vocalists overemphesize the S sound and are sing in a long hallway.,3
"I could not stop playing it. Every time I fail a level, i just wanna try again! Its so addictive",5
I use to have a Aneroid phone and was able to have all of the bubble pop games. I love these games they need to make all of them for the Kindle Fire.,5
"I had this app on an older android device, it was pre-installed. It was months before I tried it. On a day when I was really ""blue""' I tried it, and I thought it was a real ""blast"" I searched the amazon app store for android, and found it, downloaded it onto my coby mid8240, its free, and still a real ""blast"".",5
very absorbing and addictive. you hunger for the next level. one of my top five favorite apps. and i recommend it for anyone,5
Great app to kill time... I love the magma mobile apps. I just wish they would add the other games.,5
A lot of fun to play.  Even got my sister hooked on it!  Keeps mind active figuring out each puzzle.,5
This game was recommended to me by a friend and she told me it would become addictive and she was right.  It is fun and the time goes by very quickly while playing the game.,5
I do not like the puzzle mode but I love the arcade. I had this on my phone so I was happy to see it available for a tablet.,5
This was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed this game.  Wish there was a way to do different player profiles,4
I'm so sorry I got this game - worst game ever and I'm uninstalling the same day I got it.  even free it's not worth it.,1
"This is quite an entertaining little game to while away some time. Graphics are smooth, play goes well, and it's just mindless enough to relax with while not being so easy that it gets boring.",4
good fun! took a level or two to figure out the objective but I don't play many games. I like it!,5
"Bubble Blast is to the current generation what Tetris was to the older one: requires some coordination and visual logic, is aesthetically pleasing, and is highly addictive.  You can have a meaningful short game as well as hunker down for a max score sort of game.  I use this on both my samsung galaxy s3 and my kindle fire hd, and I recommend it to those inclined to maze/logic games...",5
"The only problem with this game is the number of hours that you will spend popping bubbles!! Fun, fun, fun!",4
"love it, Colors great, fun to play, love the back grounds,  never had problems fun fun fun fun fun fun",5
"It's a challenge to play. I spend hours playing just trying to solve the puzzle. I highly recommend this game. It didn't look fun at first, but I decided to play with it. Now I love to play.",5
There was not much to the game. you touched a water ball and it broke up and hopefully hit the other water balls so they would touch other and on and on. This is a good game for 1st graders on down.,2
"This is fun game worth the download.  It is free after all.  Very low-budget look to it but still fun.  Inconsistent as far as how challenging the levels are but not a huge deal.  For example, I will blow through like 10 levels in 5 minutes but then randomly get stuck on one for forever.  And then after that one a bunch more easy ones.  To me the game seems to easy but I still play it.  And it still gets 5 stars from me.",5
"This is a fun app to play with. I can now use my Kindle Fire as a light source. It was a free app at the time and that is why I downloaded it, but it is fun to play with.",5
"great idea. very functional.this app works as designed and has lots of options. It is useful and fun.If you are someone who always misplaces real flashlight, this could come in handy.",5
You can use it when walking around or to look around a dark room.  Cute app.....I like how it changes colors,4
After having other flashlight apps this is by far the best one because of the various colors available and the emergency blinking and help light.  I have it installed on all of my phones and tablets.,5
"This is a simple, user friendly program that does just what it says it will and does it well. I realized after I got it that I didn't need all the colors and patterns and as they say 'bells and whistles' but they don't interfere and my grandkids think they are pretty important.",5
"Love the various effects and that they can be changed to any color easily. There is a 5 Sec countdown at the bottom for the ads &amp; then they go away. Not horribly intrusive.You can change the text to say whatever you want, reverting back to &quot;help&quot; with just a tap. I hope I never need it, but nice to know it's there. Overall a sound app.",5
I already had this app on my Droid and use it all the time for reading to my son at night and for moving across the dark bedroom where my daughter is sleeping.  The cool effects are also fun.  So glad to find that this app works just as well on my Kindle Fire!  Especially love being able to adjust the brightness.,5
The candle flame grew and now is to the far right of the screen and I can't shrink and center it. Not a bad app,3
"I can't rate this as it never worked on my device. Hopefully, it will work on yours. After all, it's free.",2
it is a good app all of the flashlights r cool except 1 and that's the candle flashlight is only half of a candle flame on the side of a screen,3
brillantbefore huriccane Issac I looked at a lot of flashlight apps but couldn't find the perfect one I got this app and decided that this was perferct cool. olors and affects,5
I use this a lot very bright beautiful colors you can make them flash or should color it really helps looking in a dark place!,5
I hated it it was crap don't get it.jk Jk jk jk JKJK.it was good I recommend it for people entertained easily,1
"this flashlight works and its easy to figure out. i like all of the different colors and the strobe light, etc.  it really works and the best thing is, i havent come across any ads that i remember and its completely freeee!!!!!",4
"The light is bright and all one needs in a flashlight; however, it makes this weird high-pitched noise whenever the app is started that scares my dog, so I deleted it.",2
"It is fantastic, I have it in the Kindle Fire and it works like a really lamp, and the colors, the different types of lights, it really works, you can have at your side in the night and you don't have to turn on any light, you just open your kindle and it is there!",5
nice does what it says and makes a nice color light to fill the room any color you want looks cool at night...,5
I had this app on my smart phone and use it and love how well it works. I was worried that it would not work as well on my KFHD. IT WORKS GREAT! My Granddaughters even like to play around with it! Lol,5
"Love this app!!  It is not just a flashlight, it has several options to choose from, as well as, several different colors to choose from.  I personally love the candle.  Don't know how much I will use it, but it is still cool none the less.",5
"Works on the Kyros!This was one of the first apps I purchased, and although I don't use it often, it's just fun to have. I suspect that this is designed more for a phone, but it works perfectly on the Kyros tablet as well. Bonus points: There's even a candle/floating flame!Other neato, completely useless fun things: You can set the color to anything you choose. There are several animated options as well, including a HYPNOTIZING SPIRAL.I keep hoping for a rave, so I can whip this out and be like ubercool. Being in my forties, I don't get invited to those as often as I'd like, but at least I'm now prepared.",5
"I think this app is great it can be very entertaining and definitely noticeable. you can change the colors and the actions such as a spiral, police car, and a strobe light, etc. I got this app for power outages and I bet it will make my nieces happier in the dark.",5
"I do not often need this  app, but it has been a lifesaver on a more than one occasion.  I love it.",5
"This is more than just a flashlight.  There are about 12 different patterns with moving parts in them that are awesome.You even get to move the little bar to make the color that you want.  I love the scrolling words... you can write what youwant it to say and it is like a billboard.  There is a moving hypnosis pattern. Blinking, rainbow, and others. You shouldcheck it out. It is a much better app than regular flashlight ones.",5
I use this every night to check on my little one without turning lights on.  I have used it several times during power outages from storms.  Unlike our flashlight my kindle is always at hand or in my bag.  Having it  close when there are power issues has calmed my little guy immensely.  Thank you for this.,5
"I just got this app. Not only is it fun to play around with, but useful, too. I had to use it during a freak power outage!",5
I have this app on my kindle fire and my favorite is the police w/the police noise I love Color flashlight get this app! O.o have a nice day.,5
"In the dark, this light is so bright I had to go to settings to back it down some. I DO appreciate the brightness but when I'm moving around in the house at 3am I don't want to wake everyone with a light force equal to a 747. I'm sure there will be a time when I need 100% of the product. I'm happy to have the choice.",5
"With 12 different color effects the Color Flashlight app is a really useful app. I got it for my Kindle Fire HD and it utilizes the screen as a bright backlight, like a lightboard. The light is very bright and can illuminate any dark room. I even use with my DSLR camera to add some light to my pictures. The effects are fun and cool. Especially the siren in police color effect.Real cool free app with some nice custom features.",4
I like this app because I can use it to photograph my small items to put on EBAY or my Etsy store.,5
All I wanted was a flashlight for getting around in the dark.  I know there are some other features on this but I just wanted a nice bright white light and nothing else.  Works great.,5
loved the color changing option.I think the decorative lights are alsoworth the downloading of this appthis is a keeper,5
"I got this app for my Samsung Galaxy S because my other flashlight app wouldn't let me move it to my external SD card.This app lights up your screen. Your options include: pick any solid color, change the brightness, or select an effect. Effects include text, emergency, strobe, blink, police lights, rainbow, scroll, spiral, disco, slide, or candle.That is all there is to this app and exactly what I needed for my phone.",5
"Very fun! A lot brighter than I thought it would be. It's adjustable and has some fun, wild lights, too.",5
Works perfectly on my K Fire first gen. even the candle option is properly centered &amp; pretty. Keep in mind I use this &quot;flashlight&quot; app. on my kindles SCREEN because there is no camera hole to make a &quot;flashlight beam&quot;. So for use on my screen this app is Great. It offers many color options as well as strobe &amp; other effects and is very bright.,5
"it's storming right now. I don't know if you'll beloved this but the power went out at my house at 12:16 am and I had bought the app about an hour earlier, super useful",5
"Used this to move around when it was dark and others were sleeping.  It was great to not wake up the hubby, and still be able to take care of things.  I loved it.",5
I like to play backgammon.,3
"I played all the levels and didn't find that there was any bias to the computer rolling more doubles than myself....also, I only consider myself to be a slightly above average player and find it rather easy to beat the computer at level 5.  So either I'm a better player than I think I am or the game's AI  could stand a little improvement. That said, the game is an enjoyable time killer and seems to work flawlessly without any bugs or glitches.  The operation and animation is smooth and the controls are quite easy to use on even the smallest screened smartphone.  I'll be keeping this one in my game apps....at least until I find something better.",4
Works smoothly - ads not invasive - plenty of gameplay options with doubling cube and 5 computer player difficulties or two human player option. Very well done!,5
"I miss playing backgammon and this is a nice way to be able to play when I can't find a partner.  I enjoy playing and winning, so I just use the easier levels.  Occasionally the CPU will get some strange runs of doubles but looking at the stats shows that it is not that bad.  For people really wanting a challenge, I would suggest using a high difficultly level.  It makes some pretty stupid moves, like moving pieces in the home area to a better take off position while there are still pieces outside of the home area.  But maybe the harder difficultly level corrects that.",4
This is a great Backgammon game with a very colorful board and many options.  And it's free.  What more could you ask for?,5
"Fun game to spend time waiting for the Doctor, for food at s restaurant, at the dog park, ,at the DMV etc..",5
A good past time while waiting in a Doctor's office or anywhere else that their time is more important than yours..,4
"This is a neat version of backgammon.  It gives you choice of playing single, double player games or multiple match games.",5
Bought this to learn how to play as it has been years since my last real game. Fit the bill as a refresher just fine and turned out to be rather enjoyable to just play too.,4
"Just like a backgammon board. I like any game that simulates the real thing, without having pieces to lose. Fun game.",4
"Best backgammon app I've played. Shows possible moves an  keeps track of pips. No obnoxious ads either, which is always a bonus!",5
I have  always loved this game but I wish the computer did not cheat so much. Its not much fun playing a game you're 99%  sure you will loose anyway. I will keep playing because I love the game.,4
I play this game just about every night before I go to bed. It is just as much fun as the board version. I couldn't be happier with this free app.,5
it is a game that gives me something to do. the Ai is almost like playing a real person. it changes the way it plays.,4
The game produces way to many doubles to fit into the bell curve of possible events. Because of this distribution the game uses the strategy of stacking until the doubles show up to be played in the game. Not a normal strategy for a normal backgammon game.,2
This app runs really well and is so much fun to play.  I've tried ones that weren't free that didn't run nearly as well as this one.,5
"83% of the time the Cpu wins on the first roll. 68% of the time the Cpu outscores on doubles. If you have the opportunity to roll you own dice do it and if that's the case get a life, make a friend and enjoy some human interaction with a real game.",2
The game is fine except for the dice.  The computer has received four doubles in a row on multiple occasions... a near improbability in reality.  Either the random algorithm is flawed or it had been intentionally programmed to give the computer opponent an advantage through dice rolls at harder levels instead of more intelligent moves.  I don't think rigging the dice roles is appropriate as a means of increasing difficulty levels.  Not representative of real life at all.  Very disappointed.,1
I love playing backgammonthis game offers a variety of difficulty which makes it perfect for both beginners and seasoned players,5
"I really enjoy this app, its great for filling in time between appoitments or just sharing time with kids and introducing them to new games",5
"This app taught two 8-year-olds how to play in less than 10 minutes, and is one of my favorite apps for both Smartphone &amp; Tablet. Thank you, AI Factory.:^)",5
"It is an okay game. Sometimes though I think it (cpu) has an un fair advantage. It's almost like it cheats, just when I'm starting to win. So then the computer starts getting lots of 4-of-a-kind dice and I lose the game. Strange, huh?",3
"I wasn't sure how easy it would be to play this on my mobile phone (Sprint LG LS670), but it is great.  Backgammon is my FAVORITE all time game.  It's easy and user friendly, if you already know how to play Backgammon.  You can choose which color you want to be (black or white) and you can pick whether you want to play from north to south or south to north. You can play the computer or a real person. There is a tutorial if you've never played Backgammon.  I highly recommend this game especially if you already know how to play!",5
"I'm new to Kindle (5 days), and LOVE this game! I have bacgammon on my Hoyle disc for the computer--this is great for other times.",5
works as advertised. you can play multiple games and see your results.  games are saved as is. its O K,3
"This is a great little app - can be very addictive and has definitely helped my ""real time"" backgammon skills, I don't think there is a day that goes by that I don't play a few quick games, usually before going to sleep.  Much better than watching the late night news!  Highly recommend this for experienced backgammon players to sharpen their skills, or for beginners to learn the moves that you should automatically think of when you throw the dice and your numbers come up.Friends have commented that my skill level is approaching deadly :)  of course, I haven't told them why.  LOVE THIS APP. almost as much as I love my Kindle Fire!",5
The graphics and Speed on this game are very good. A good way to play backgammon on the go. It's one of my standbys.,5
"This game is really fun if you are just looking for some fun while you are bored,  but I can see why you wouldn't like it if you are a big backgammon gamer. The dice rolls are a tad bit unacerate considering doubles happen a lot. I am not a huge gamer when it comes to backgammon so I love this game and I play it all of the time! My advice is to get it and try it out. If you don't like it, I mean, it's free!! ;)",4
"I really enjoy backgammon.  I remember playing it frequently with my dad, learning strategy....I have many reviews concerning this app and the &quot;AI cheats&quot;, especially at higher levels, is very common.Here are my stats after 61 matches played at level 4:Me  CPUMatches won -  56.  5Rounds won.  -  385  226Total Pts Scored -  669  488 (I ran up the doubling cube to 64 one game &amp; lost by 300+)Opponent Pcs Hit -  1297  1225Doubles Rolled -  2067  2009I have learned how the AI 'thinks' and have USED STRATEGY to defeat it.  Now, with that said, I don't play level 5 since I cannot seem to 'crack' the AI's [cheating].",4
ive played backgammon for years and now its on my kindle and its free! how can you beat that! love it love it....thank you!,5
game loads quickly and is fun to play.  different levels alllow User to determine length and difficulty of the game,4
Classic board game that can be played with friends or family. No clean up or lost pieces and the noisy shaker is not a problem at night. Love it.,5
Not a lot of skill to play this game.  The computer gets more doubles and better numbers than the player.  Realy feel that the computer is rigged to cheat to win.  Not fun!!,2
"If you like Backgammon, you will love this version. It has two different looks with either Black and White or Red and White, allows doubling on/off as well as Crawford Rule enabled/disabled. Works well on my Droid, does not get too annoying with ads that get in the way of play.",5
My daughter told me about this because we played it a lot when she was younger so I downloaded it on my Smart Phone and Kindle Fire.,5
"Great game.  I especially like the fact that I can go back several steps to see what moves would work better.  It is making me a better player.I would like to see a &#34;Finish&#34; button, which would automatically finish the game when I choose it.",4
"I enjoy playing backgammon anyway, so this game is a joy.  It is a great way to past time and enjoy it.",5
"This game is fun but after a number of games is played, you will find that you are a better backgammon player. Good for sharpening your mind.",5
"keeps kicking me out to force close. Shame, though because I love this game.  Worked great for two weeks, then kaput!",3
I love to play backgammon and this free game really delivers. You can play against the computer or with another person. Great game.,5
This version of backgammon has been both fun and helpful. I am new to the game so I didn't know the rules or anything. This has been excellent in learning how to play.,4
"I play this all the time.  I love all the different options given for number of points for a match, etc.",5
This is a lot of fun and very addictive!  It gives a lot of options for each s y to hard games,5
I even get mad like I'm really playing against someone!! Thank you for a great product. I use it on my Kindle Fire and the graphics are spectacular!,5
Easy to use.  Challenging enough for a casual player.  I'm not good enough to know how it is for an expert.  I recommend it.,4
"Fun enough, and as a beginner I learned the game. I didn't, in the end, like the game itself (the app was fine).",4
"The only reason I rated the game at 4 stars is there is no way to play over the net. Otherwise, the game rates 5 stars with no crashing or bugs that I have discovered. I would recommend this app for anyone.",4
I have beenn playing this free app for years. I still enjoy playing after all this time. I recommend this for anyone looking to build some basic strategy skills.,5
"This is another classic game that I had never learned.  However, it's easy to pick up, and plays fairly quickly.  You can adjust the difficulty level from a novice (which I was) to expert.  Even on the very first level up the computer gets a little aggressive and starts taking your pieces!  I really enjoyed this game!",5
Years ago I used to play backgammon all the time.  I had forgotten all about it.  I downloaded it to my kindle and now play several times a day.  I am learned all over again.  Like it a lot.,4
Would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys backgammon. Good game with lots of options.  Even a good game for a beginner as it has many different levels.,5
I've have played backgammon since I was a teenager. This version is so much like the real world game I almost forgot I am playing against the computer. At the highest level I am challenged just like when I am playing against my friends.,5
I love backgammon.  The only problem I have is that I believe the game may be cheating me.  The game usually wins.,4
The whole family loves this game as we play tournaments and high score and low score. It would be cool to have Acey-duecey  as an added game!Thanks,5
I have always loved backgammon and now I can play it on my own! Smart  AI interface that keeps you coming back for more. Bonus: you can also play with two players! Thanks for making it free!,5
i love this game. I play this all the time. It gets harder and harder. It challenges me each level.,5
"Fun, uncomplicated. Used to play backgammon a lot and forgot how entertaining it is. Anyone can play, but it helps to understand game strategy. No issues with app on my Xoom or HTC phone.",4
This game is easy to use and fun to play.  I plan against the computer and find it enjoyable.  I recommend this game to any amateur that loves to play.,5
"So, another good buy on the Amazon special of a game that has good reviews (or better).  Hoping to enjoy it on my android as so many others have.",5
It traeger my mind playing the game at anytime! And knowledgeble in the dice too and move counts!And like backgammon it teaches me?,4
"I was not overly impressed with this game.  I wanted to play with other people not the computer, could not figure out how to do that.",2
I've love this gameI'm happy with this one.easy to play definitely worth the downloadworks well smooth graphics are clear.,5
I love playing backgammon.  This game allows you to pick your level of play and whether you play against the computer or against other players.,5
I remember my Grandfather teaching me acey ducey as a kid. I love sitting and playing backgammon.  I Sam teaching my daughter this game too. Runs great. No problems,4
"Good features: multiple diff levels, take back, both one player and two player games. At it's highest level it is not as good as fibzilla for pc. It seems weak with the cube. Very good, just shy of perfect. Recommended.",4
it is a very good game but sometime I need bigger challenges. other than that it I one of the best gammon on the kindle fire.-,5
This version of backgammon is perfect!! Both for the beginner player or the expert player. You can't get it any better than this!,5
"Well, Backgammon is always going to be Backgammon no matter how you shake it up, but I do like this particular app. I like the themes and it's challenging!",5
"Is easy n fun, kids can figure out quick n enjoy as well.. me n hub like it slot.. you have to of coarse enjoy backgammon.. lol",5
This is quite a good game but very small to see so I uninstalled it to make room for another game.,3
"fun to play against the computer or in two player mode.  There are settings for how many games to play before you win also.If you like backgammon this has nice graffics.  I only wish the &#34;roll the dice&#34; was on the right side, I keep hitting double play by mistake.",5
I loved this app. I play it everyday. I would recommend it for everyone. I love that my husband can play it with me as well. I love that I can take it with me everywhere.,5
I used to play the board game with my mother and other family members.  It's lots of fun.  Hope you'll enjoy it too!,4
"nice game play where the computer actually makes fairly decent plays compared to a lot of these. easy to set up,",5
It has many different levels for beginners or more advanced players. The graphics are smooth and there has been no freezing up of  any kind that seems to happen with so many games like this. Only annoyance is the pop up ads to get other games by this company.,4
Very good for a free app.  The scoring totals don't mean much. Points from the doubling cube are only applied to the game and the pip score isn't cumulative.,4
"I play backgammon several different ways on my computer, kindle and the real board game.  It is always fun to adapt to chance games where dice are involved.",3
"This is a good app, I have enjoyed playing it since i got it. since i enjoy playing Backgammon anyway this app allows to play backgammon more often.",5
"Great for single player or two players, beginners or more advanced players. Love that the statistics can be reset anytime.",5
"Great app for those learning the game or the experts who like to play for $$$. (My family includes both.)Decent graphics, fast play, very easy to instantly customize for multiple players. Family and co-workers love the features. Thanks for this free app that's superior to most pay games!",5
And smooth app that's a great way to learn the game or relearn what's been forgotten not to mention the best way to pass time,5
"I have this product on my android phone and it works very well.  However, it is not really that easy to use on my Kindle Fire.",2
"I loved backgammon as a  young woman of the 80's, so I figured I'd download this and take a trip down memory lane.  Well, for the life of me, I couldn't remember how to play.  So the first stop was the help button and within a few minutes, it all came back  to me.  Whether I play the game with my husband or with the computer, it's a great way to  pass some time.  This game is easy on the eyes and the ads won't hinder your gameplay.",5
I love playing backgammon. I have been playing it since my college days and will be teaching my grandson how to play soon. Very fun and entertaining.,5
I haven't played backgammon for years so I may be a little rusty. This game is pretty good overall but I was hoping for more. Good graphics and good movement. The rules could be a little more detailed and clearer though.,4
"Looking for games that I love that can be loaded on the Kindle.  Found this backgammon game and have enjoyed it.  The graphics are very good, the instructions were clear and the options were nice.",4
"Best free app, play it daily. I'm addicted to it. Have not had any problems at all. Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.",5
"I really enjoy this app. I've once again begun to enjoy this woderful game and don't feel like in some Backgammon that they cheat with the dice, this one is great for a free app.",5
"Good teaching game.  Try and beat the Cpu,  test different stratagies.  I enjoy this game.  Game offers the different skill levels to try and improve ones skills.",2
Opponent knowledge of stragety (GWB !) disappears near end of the game.  Opponent will continue to move low numbers within the board when it would be of more advantage to move discs in to home,4
"Unlike many games, the ads on this one do not bother me and I do not find them intrusive. This free version of backgammon is easy to play, but still challenging. It seems as if the computer ""learns"" from my moves; at least this is how I see it and it makes the game more challenging.  I have it on my phone and Kindle Fire. Many games look too small on a cell phone, making them difficult to play, but this one is not so it makes a good diversion while waiting in line or when I am sitting around, waiting at places such as an auto repair shop or doctor's office.",5
If you are a champion player this is probably not the app for you but if you like a good game of backgammon without any bad glitches this is it.,4
One way to use your brain for a few minutes.  I find it hard to read a book in most doctors offices as they all seem to have a TV turned up LOUD!  My Kindle Fire HD is great for playing Backgammon - super fun time passer.,5
"Is the game I've played for 35 yrs/better part of my life. And playing as 1 person against the computer is a good challenge. Thumbs up, keeper.",5
it's great if you don't want to play anybody but a bot!!!  I give this a 5 rating or more!,5
"Really like this app.  Yes it does get lots of doubles,  but it makes up for it by the strategy it uses in its home quadrant.  (I just won 2 pts. because it didn't rake off even 1 of its chips when it could.)  I get doubles, too.  Sometimes several in a row.  It's random!  Easy to use.",4
I am not the best backgammon player and this game is helping me to improve my game.  I like that you can change the difficulty level.  Fun game.,3
"Easy to load and easy to play. At times I question the neutrality of the dice throws. It seems to give itself a disproportionate number of doubles.  Also,  it seems to dawdle at the end spending more time, and rolls, lining up it's pips in it's home area instead of bearing them off. Still an enjoyable way to spend a few minutes at a time playing a game.",4
"Pretty good when playing single mode.  App definitely has the better stats; always seems to get the very roll it needs.  LOL. If you just want to play  I highly recommend downloading.  Best I've used and better than some Internet Backgammon games.  Didn't give 5 stars because of the dice issues in single player mode.  I'm a sore loser, what can I say.",4
It is a good thing this game is free! I would have asked for my money back if not. Do not waste you time!,1
"I would give this product a higher score, but when you play th he computer if grants an inordinately disproportionate number of higher doubles and higher dice rolls to th e computer. Seems more reasonable e w h energy playing between two live opponents!!!",3
very challenginf and entertaining yet allows multiple players rating asks for to much information which makes submitting a review annoying,4
"The game is good, a challange.  one question.....Why is there no Acey/Ducey with any backgammon games??? I for one, would enjoy that.",4
I love to play Backgammon. This ap is so realistic. Just like my real board. If you like to play Backgammon then this app is for you. Try it!,5
"I started to play and immediately noticed how easy it was to win using real world dice compared to their cheating virtual dice, I never saw such blatant cheating on games as in this version, Al take back ur slick game . It is easier using virtual die but I got too frustrated with the game setting up all their moves, why play computer backgammon if you still handle dice?",2
"This game will keep you on your toes, no matter what level.  Keep you entertained.  And the choice of level e is does a great job of making the game very challenging",4
Nicely designed game. It plays easily & has adjustable AI to give you a challenge. Plus it it keeps stats and it is free!,5
-dice obviously role in cavorted of the computer.-even though I shut off the option for 4 dice it still roles 4-uninstalling,2
"OMG! I luv the game, but sometimes it seems the computer cheats. More doubles for the computer then the real person. All in all this is a great game. Should make it so you can play with other real people. Now that would be great!",5
Never can find someone who loves the game as much as I do or has the time to play when I do. This app does very well for me.,4
Can some one be in love with a game? I say heck yes!!!! I can't let a day go by without playing.  You can set your own challenge level.,5
"This is an excellent version of backgammon.  Very easy to play or undo your moves.  Although, sometimes it really looks like the CPU is cheating, I do not believe it does.  I have beat this game so many more times than I have lost and I have played at level 4, a lot.  Plus, I have played many other backgammon computer games &amp; none compare to this one.  The higher the level the more the CPU uses classic strategy moves and it also hits your piece more, but that goes with any good board game.  All things considered this is a worth while game to down load and purchase.",5
"I'm addicted to this one. I have it on my phone and on my Kindle Fire. I play it when I'm in a waiting room, or just about anytime I'm alone and don't have anything else to do. LOVE this game! Takes me back to my high school years, when my friends and I played backgammon all the time.",5
This is a. Last from the past. I haven't played this since I was little.  It's. Still as I remember it and still a lot of fun. Thank you.,5
Fun if you play singles or with any other player. Lots of levels. You can learn to be a better by going up the levels,5
"[From my mother] This game is easy to download, play and gives you a good little challenge. Thank you for creating it, it's a fun game.",4
"Learn to play from my Armenian Grandfather years ago.  But, I think the program cheats...shame on you...learn to play betterwith strategy.",5
"Nice app for free, easy for beginners to learn how to play.  I always liked to play this game now I can play against the computer.",4
"If you enjoy playing backgammon, be sure to get this app. You get enough options to make the rounds challenging,whether you're playing with a human opponent or against the computer.",4
This is an addictive game. I forgot how much fun this board game really is. You will find yourself playing for hours.,5
"I USED TO PLAY THIS BOARD GAME WITH MY BROTHERS ALL THE TIME GROWING UP. IT WAS MY FAVORITE, NEXT TO SCRABBLE. IT'S AWESOME THAT NOW I CAN PLAY IT ON KINDLE, AND NOT HAVE ALL THE PIECES TO DEAL WITH..",4
I love the game of backgammon. This is a little slow . Due to the way you need to tap the keys more than once sometime .,4
"I have been winning.  I started at the lowest difficulty and worked my way up.  I only lost one game out of 25, won every game at the highest level.Dinice",3
"This above average app. does provide varied bare essential experience.I won't  extoll it's virtues,  but fret the meager skill level.Specifically, tweak the differential at levels 3-5.A-1, get to work.Gregg Gamer",3
"I've only played this app a few times on easiest level...but seems fun! Love backgammon, now I can take it with me everywhere! I've read complaints that in the higher levels the game gets a suspicious amount of doubles compared to the human player...well that's just like playing against my hubby and his loaded dice! LOL So I would definitely recommend this app to any and all backgammon fans!",5
"Your choice of levels in skill, one or multiplayer, and the hints are very helpful when you are not concentrating on your game as you should. Shows possible moves by lighting up.",5
I have just about all of this developers aps and am happy with them. I play on my Razr and my kindle fire. play is slow/jumpy on the kindle but I still enjoy playing.,5
"Thanks for this app, it has always been a favorite of mine. I get my coworkers at work to play and it helps pass the time when nothing is going on.",5
The only drawback is not being able to reject the first roll. Otherwise it's great and I play it daily.,4
this is a favorite.  i've have a hand held game for years and really enjoy playing it. just about anyone over 10 can play it,5
I play this game all the time I love it! Easy to play and I would recommend it to everyone!,5
"Most of the free Backgammon games I've tried either cheat to win all the time or ""give away"" the game to make you feel good.  This one however has multiple skill levels and number of players options to give you a fun time all the time.",5
just like real backgammon.  works awesome on my fire so I'm happy. dl was fine and didn't take long. so far so good,5
"Always wanted to play this game , but I didn't know anyone who played.  This is my go to game now when I want to relax.  Recommend this to all.  It will keep you entertained.",5
I have been a backgammon addict for years and this is a nice app. I enjoy playing on my down time.,5
"This is good for people who want to learn how to play and get a few ideas about strategies. Its not great and would give intermediate players wrong strategies. One thing I like, it does show players not to be too conservative. However it will double at the wrong time and take doubles it should not. I've been rated master, well 35 years ago, so I expect a lot lol. Its free, get it and learn to play, but not for serious players wanting to grow in ability.Entry level only. Well to relieve stress I play it to wipe it out. Then once in 7 series it beats me because I'm taking wild chances and because it starts throwing more doubles and getting perfect rolls. I guess there is luck, it sure gets lucky. :( I think programmed to do that once in a while.",3
my favorite part is that i can play anywhere and anytime%) .  playing against the computer is fun and challenging?.,4
Good action. System is not too predictable unlike some I have tried. Different levels allow for multiple users. System wastes moves in bearing off pieces. Allows too many chances to come from behind.,5
Fun game. I have always enjoyed playing backgammon. This version is quick and easy to use great for two players that don't want to take time to set up a real game.,5
I enjoy backgammon and I love this one! The only thing that I would change would be to add an option for Acey-Deucey.,5
"this game was not for me, to small for my screen but it was worth a try hope you enjoy ti .",2
"Yes, the cpu rolls just what it needs suspiciously often, even at level 5. However, I play daily and am now beating the cpu 6 of every 10 games, average. I've even gammoned it several times. If you're a competitive level player, keep searching. Graphics are nice, and I like the fact that there's directionality options, but it won't challenge you enough if you are a serious player.",3
This is a fun app. I will play this one a lot. Enjoy that you don't need two or more players. Love it,5
it is fun to play and I am going to try to teach my 7 year old grandson how to play. I think if he can get the ides of the gane hewill like it too.,4
"I love to play, but I never have anyone to play with. This makes it so I can play against the computer.",5
First the game plays true then it cheats once the cube is doubled it throws doubles and manages to throw just what it needs for kills. I've played Backgammon for over 40 years I know a cheat when I see it!,1
I enjoy playing this version of backgammon immensely! The game has good graphics and game options.  I would recommend this application to anyone who likes the game. I think you will like it as much as I do if you try it.  It was free which made it even better.,4
"The computer cheats; It consistently gets more doubles, but the graphics are food and the play is fast.  I even win a few.",5
"Despite AI's claim to the contrary, this program cheats.  I've had this one day, played maybe 10 games, and every time I've put it on the bar it gets out on the first roll.  One game it got out three times in a row when I had four covered.  And it wasn't the same spot open every time.  The 6/1, 3/1, 4/2 rolls to start the game for them and the 6/2, 6/3 rolls for me are quite regular, too.  And guess how often those open pips get hit....  Prepare to be frustrated, like with every other computer version you've played.  At least it was free.",2
I love this app. I just wish it had an auto play. When it gets down to the last bit and there is only one choice I wish it would complete it for me. I am a speed player and it slows me down.,4
"Only complaint - that it won't reverse when I turn my kindle. Other than that, love it and hate it - especially when the computer seems to get doubles more often than I think I do. However, it has stats at the end of every game showing how many points each the CPU and I had, how many doubles we rolled etc. Darn if I didn't have more doubles than it did most times.Fun entertainment.",4
"I just loaded the checkers app by this developer and loved it so went looking for more apps by them and found backgammon.  Years ago I used to play daily and entered public tournaments (we were not elite players - just players who were obsessed with backgammon).  However I have not played a lot recently and am not familiar with all the online games or other apps.  I played the app at the most difficult setting and found it worked well and was fun to play.  The app works like a full tablet sized app on my ASUS Transformer tablet.  This app looks good (not as richly colored as checkers but still nice), the pieces move smoothly (no lagging), and the board lights potential moves.  Nice app in my opinion!",5
the hardest level is actually challenging for me . I like that you can undo your moves. I think beginners to moderat players will also love this game.,5
"Very good backgammon game.  Ai isn't really as good as it could be, rather predictable. Otherwise, its great. I think you will enjoy playing. Opinions of the author are solely my own.)",5
"best i have used on android. good board and color options to get home in the corner you want. does not cheat, good play to get good board positions make dice rolls look lucky :-)  great job.",5
I played when I was a kid.  Never understood strategy. After playing for a while I am beginning to understand the subtleties of the game. Very enjoyable.,5
Great implementation of a classic game. Great implementation of a classic game. Great implementation of a classic game. Nuf said!,5
This is good for all levels of expertise.  Also good if you're learning.  Game functions well on my Galaxy tab 3.,5
Nice and fun app. was easy to use on the kindle fire. i had no issues or problems. i would recommend it,4
The only negative thing about this game is it doesn't start from the beginning.  The game is already in progress when you log on.,4
I love this game but I would love it more if I could link it with an actual human being. Gets a little boring beating the computer every so often. Would love to have chat capabilities too!,5
"One of the best free apps out there. There are enough customizable options to make everyone happy. You have to work at it to lose on easy. On the hardest level, a win is a victory and the dice always roll in favor of the computer.  It is great that it has a 2 player option that you can use to pass it back and forth for live play. Best of all, it has a great interface that doesn't make you work hard to figure out how to play the darn thing!  The graphics are nice as well.  The free version is ad supported but they the ads aren't annoying and don't interfere with game play.",5
What more can you ask for...Free. I thought this might be annoying with adds and such but was pleasantly surprised.,5
I love backgammon and this is a good substitute for a partner.  I've played all the levels and even at the highest the computer doesn't have the blood lust a human has to gammon someone.  Still fun to play.,5
I love this game. This is just like the one on my phone except it is so clear. Everything comes up so fast.,5
"such a fake artificial intelligence! levels 1-4 feel relatively legit but the second you play level 5 everything goes wrong! y make computer cheat?!!! From always getting convenient doubles to getting perfect rolls to catch u each time to when you're caught and rolling to get off the center it'll take 3 rolls with only one or two of the rows blocked. Dirty game, plenty of other MUCH better free backgammon apps out there, pass these guys up!",1
The program is written so that there are too many doubles. Playing with real dice is more accurate than the computer generated dice but who wants to do that??? Not me. I'm looking for a different version that doesn't cheat as much.,2
I love this app start out easy and advance as you practice. If you are a backgammon player or a beginner you will enjoy it,5
I've always liked Backgammon and I was happy when I found this game. I like that there are different skill levels.,5
It's quiet in doctor's offices and other places where noise would be irritating to others. It's a lot lighter than my board,5
"And fair app, unlike many it doesn't give an unfair advantage to either side. Makes it easier to learn and easier to improve your game.",4
"At the mid levels of play the app has an odd mix of strategies. Also, sure it's certainly just coincidence, but I have yet to win the opening roll of the dice.",4
Dice rolls.for AI improve with difficulty.  AI totals were consistently +20 my totals on level 5.  Rolls are balanced on level 3,3
"I am addicted to this game. I had played Backgammon years ago but had forgotten how to play. With this game, it's easy to learn and works great on my Kindle Fire. There are 5 different levels and you can control how many games are in each match. I recommend this whether you've played Backgammon before or not.",5
"I really like playing this game.  I have it on my phone, my tablet and my kindle.  This game is one of the few games that I keep going back to playing when I get tired of new ones that I download.",5
This has very nice backgounds for your tablet. I like all the choices of free backgounds. Thanks for this app and the free backgounds.,5
I am a fan of Backgammon and I love this version. Great levels to increase difficulty.hI I highly recommend this game.,5
the game is fun.  But when you are playing the computer you very seldom win. It seems like the computer always gets lots of doubles when behind and comes back and beats you. It cheats.,3
"I love this game,it fast paced & I don't have to sit for a long time waiting on the other player to move.",5
"Allows me to set level of difficulty so I can win all the time or just some of the time!  No bugs found, easy to learn.",5
"This is a cool game if you already know how to play, and you never know when playing single mode when the computer is going to play a nice game or go for the blood game..love that!! A good deal for the $.",5
"I like it, have at this point only played it a few times, but am still learning how it works, I know how to play the game, I just have never used some of the things that it offers. So hey for free I am definitely not complaining, if you like backgammon and you like free give it a try, it is worth it.",4
I use to play this game all the time with friends and I have missed it have to learn to be ruthless again.  LOL,5
"I've been using this game to pass the time...waiting in a doctors office, waiting for my food order, waiting for my computer to do its scan, etc.  I imagine this will also be a good one for the airplane.  Glad I got it.",5
Why pay a lot of money for a game when you can play it for free. I have played it on my phone for a long time and everyone plays it. Money does not make a game good. All you have to do is change your levels. Thank you for making this available for everyone.,5
If you like to play backgammon then you will love this game.  There are different levels and different number of players.  It loads fast and the graphics are very good.,5
I love playing this game.  It keeps me thinking about different moves to makeand wanting me to beat myself each time.,5
"Pros: This is reasonably challenging backgammon (as challenging as backgammon gets), with great non-splashy graphics.Cons: Without a human opponent, I find backgammon to be kind of mindlessly addictive. And maybe it's just my tablet (a Lenovo A2109A), but it seems to be something of a battery suck.",3
I enjoy the challenge of picking different levels of difficulty. The levels range from beginner to advanced. you may also chose how many points to play to giving you the option of a short or long game.,4
This is one of my favorite game apps. Backgammon was very popular in the 80's (even in the bars) & it's hard to find anyone who knows how to play anymore!,5
"I've been playing BG for a long time, and this game rocks. Great graphics, easy to play. Check it out.",5
"I love playing backgammon but I have a hard time finding people in my house that like to play it as well. I love having this app on my Kindle Fire. It plays smoothly, offers five levels of difficulty and and can be a challenge.I tend to play risky and most of the time it pays off. But the programming gets the best of me sometimes and I have to yell at my Kindle and tell the game is it not playing nicely. Even though I often play mean. Maybe that's why others don't want to play with me? Hmmmm.A fun app that lets you chose whether your black or white (if you chose white you have to play upside down) and offers a doubling dice.",5
"Love this game. Those complaining of &quot;cheating&quot; AI must not understand the leveled hardness. I've found it to be very fair. On easier levels, I've received 6-9 more doubles than the CPU and on the harder levels the opposite occurs.",5
"I am totally enjoying this game. No complaints, only none stop fun. I would highly recommend this game. Best free game I have.",5
"I have been enjoying this app for several days now.  Haven't found that the computer was throwing more doubles for itself than for me at all. In fact on enough occasions I have thrown more doubles!  It had been a few years since I had played Backgammon and found that using this app brought all back very quickly.  On reading the directions, I believe that most anyone could learn the basics quickly and then sharpen their skills as they increase levels.  The layout is clean and clear with no clutter. I turn off the sound on all the games I play so I won't rate that.All in all I think this is a great Backgammon app!",5
This game is additive. I usually play it as least once a day. I like that it has levels and such to make it easier and harder.,5
This is a great game of course and the playing is flawless. There are different levels so you can start off with an easy opponent or a hard one. It also has a two player mode so you can play against a friend.,5
great game! app runs very smoothly with no issues at all.  it has lots of options to customize how you want to play,5
I play many apps by this provider.  Ai Factory Limited produces quality apps for android devices. I use the Kindle fire and I have no problems with any of their apps.  They. run smoothly and seemlessly on my device.,4
"I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire and I love it. The graphics are great plus you have options for difficulty, number of rounds in a match and it keeps track of your stats as well.  It also can show you possible moves if you are a beginner.  The game pieces are large enough that it's easy to see and use. Nicely done! As usual with free aps, there is advertisement but it is totally off to one corner and does not interfere with game play. Once in a while there is an offer to download one of their other games, but it is rare and again not a problem.",5
This game is an old Classic and I love playing it so I was excited to find it for the Kindle.,5
"It is important to note that this app is free.  It works well on the Kindle and is definitely worth downloading if you're interested in backgammon even slightly to improve your technique or learn the game itself on a BASIC level.  Although there are 5 levels of AI skill, I found that the moves the AI performed questionable at level 5.  I would rate the maximum level of the AI skill far below any officially world recognized player.  The skill level of the AI is mediocre at best.  In response to some of the other reviewers comments regarding the frequency of doubles in this app there is 'some' validity to their statements.  However I found that the high double roll rates were divided equally between myself and the AI.  I found that the rate of doubles (normally 1 in 6 chances) was only slightly higher at 1 in 5.  With such a small margin between the two ratios I must therefore admit that the RNG (random number generator) is indeed random.If you an advanced player, or world ranked player - don't bother with this app, it will only frustrate you, as if you were playing a novice.  Although that at times can provide it's own challenges due to the unpredictability of their logic or lack of.Bottom line, worth the price of FREE.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.",4
I like backgammon. This is one of my favorite games. It's great to play with a partner or against the android when you need something to do to pass time.,5
"Love this game.  When I purchased it I didn't know how to play.  So, I self taught myself and have received many hours of play time.",5
"This game is relaxing, fun and helps me to release frustration...I only play the computer.  I don't play well with others. This is a good release when people are getting on your nerves...",5
I haven't played backgammon in years. Took me awhile to get the hang of it again and now enjoying it greatly. Haven't quite got those doubles figured out yet but if I can pull myself away from playing the game to read the instructions maybe I'll get them figure it out. Very nice game very well done highly recommend it.,5
This game is loads of fun. If you like the real game you. should enjoy this. People who say it cheats are total morons. It doesn't.,4
"I got this app on my Kindle fire HD. Has nice graphics. Easy way to learn the game. After about 3 months and starting to play with a real board and real players, some problems become evident .  To increase levels of difficulty the computer just rolls statistically impossible rolls. Every time it rolls what it needs to hit an unguarded pip. Every time. And it's  strategy becomes very evident. I can predict every move from each roll.  A friend who has this app has also noticed these issues. After playing the real thing  this gets frustrating. And disappointing.  Still, it was a good way to learn and practice strategy.",3
I love this game so much! You need to play this! It's a great game if you enjoy challenging rules and thinking steps ahead of your opponent!,5
"It has been years since I've played this game, and never was very good at it.  I thought this app would help me practice and it has done that.  It has 5 levels of expertise, and within a couple of weeks, I have advance up to the hardest level.  The game moves quickly, but even after reading the instructions, I still am not sure what it means when a player &#34;doubles&#34; up his throw (going from 2 to 64).",5
I enjoyed playing this game. It challenges my mind especially against the computer. You should get this game especially if you are ann avid backgammon player.:-),4
Its an easy game to play.  Graphics are clear and it gives you different options including multiple players.  If you don't know how to play its an easy version to learn.,4
True to original game. Harder levels are challenging.  Overall fun to play alone or with others. I would recommend to friends.,4
"I have really enjoyed this game, but some games really seem to have a lot of doubles, and of course they are not mine.",4
I'm in my 60's and have played board and card games since childhood. This game is so weighted in favor of the computer that I quit playing it.,2
Backgammon Free is a good app. It easily provides hours of fun. The level of difficulty with which you wish to play is your choice. So a beginner can do as well as an adept.,4
A great game added to my tablet. Hours of fun to enjoy and it helps that it was free to download,4
How could I go wrong when it was free and keeps me busy for a few matches with the computer. I win to much and the dice are predicable.,4
"I really can't complain--the ads are unobtrusive, the game play is adequate, although even at the expert level the program makes what I would consider rather elementary mistakes. While you can choose your color if you pick white you have to play upside down--the piece colors are hardwired in. There's no option for automatic double at the beginning of the game--each initial roll results in a clear winner.The authors of the game go out of their way to deny any evidence of cheating, and yet the statistics they provide would seem to belie that. After 80-odd games, the computer has rolled 10% more doubles than me, and I have been hit 30% more often than the reverse (and not for lack of trying). In other words, in the normal course of things the computer is &#34;luckier&#34; than you and will win the majority of games. However, the computer seems to be a sucker for the doubling cube and that is how I have won eight out of ten matches while losing 27 out of 50 games.",4
This game counts out the spaces for your move and highlights where you can place your game piece.  It is kind of a lazy person method and I am not sure if I like it or not.  I find that I don't use my brain and concentrate as much.  It's not bad though for a free app.,3
"Glad to play and set own settings. Game was as expected. As I improve, I can make it more challenging.",4
I love Backgammon. Another skill level - I would give this free app 5 stars. I enjoy the 2 player operation to play with family.,4
"I never played the game, therefore, I can't give a true review. I deleted it.  I cannot make a recommendation for this game",1
This game is great . I like the options it offers. You can pick the level of difficulty  so  you can play with the kids. Play alone or on line with someone. Thanks for this game,5
"I love backgammon, but playing upside down is too confusing.  I kept forgetting which color I had since I was forced to look at the board upside down. Is it possible this is how it's played south of the equator?",2
I enjoy playing this game and find it is a great way to spend the time while at the doctor's office or waiting somewhere,4
I love backgammon. This app is great. The levels of difficulty seem to be pretty accurate. Love playing it when I'm bored in class or at the office.,5
"I agree with the other 're Jews that say that even on the hard-earned, it is too easy.  It is very rare that I don't win and I'm not really that good.  Good game for a beginning player though!",4
this is really fun. big fan of backgammon but I don't know people who play this. Its nice to play even electronically.,5
This is a great version of this game.  I like that you have the option to change game.  I recommend this game.,5
"Could be a bit more challenging, yet easy to play. After a while the moves become predictable.  Yet offers a good game overall.",4
"LOVE this game. I used to play it all the time!Alas, Zynga and its witchy word games dominate my time now. Still, if you enjoy Backgammon this is a marvelous app.However, I AM one of those people who *refuses* to believe that the rolls aren't sometimes rigged. There are too many times on the tougher setting when it seems like the odds can't be wrong THAT often. HA!",5
"The best backgammon I ever played. Great look, perfect moves. I play in expert level. Highly recommend it.",5
"This a great little app.  My 8 year old learned to play on this game.  He enjoyed it so much,  I couldn't get on my Kindle.  Finally got him a backgammon board.Hours of free fun.",5
"My family has given up on playing this game with me all the time, so I have found this perfect to spend with my morning coffee.",5
player had a choice of home points being in front of them not on opposite side of board. not anymore. feelsfeels upsidedown now! lol,3
"I found only two backgammon games in the Amazon app search, and the reason why is that the folks  @ AI Factory have written a solid game for those of us that remember the reason for these once popular games before FPS and D&amp;D. Real staticical stradederies. (as Geo. Bush would say). The game lets you concentrate on why certain moves are better than others and undo when you go astray and the algorithm smacks you down.On the next update I would and a line that says &quot;Not resigning&quot; when the game score is tied and the next game decides the match, even though its looking bad!  ie, a continue play button for fun's sake.  Compact app, plays great on my Kindle Fire.  MLawson di Ransom Canyon Rock Solid Consulting.",5
Another game that is part chance and mostly skill. I win about 90% of the games but it requires deep thought.,5
Bought this and play all the time.  Not all apps work well on Kindle but this one is really great.,5
Dice worked fine on my phone-LG Optimus. Great color palette. Nicely done. Played your spades app- like both a lot. Looking forward to checking out more of your game apps. :),5
Excellent backgammon game for handheld device. Give it a try on your Kindle. I am going to look for it in Google Play for my Sony TL phone.,5
I've installed/uninstalled this many times...playing when needing a mindless ap but removing when it stresses me. Too many flaws and coincidences..I can predict how the ap will trump me. The higher the difficulty the more perfect moves the ap gets. I never get a break and only win because of the dumb way the ap finishes its removing its pieces from the board.,2
"this game is very addicted and sometime they do cheat ,  but good for long doctor visit on so on",5
LOVE THIS GAME. I PLAY IT A LOT.,5
"Different levels make it a fun game new to c experience players. Quickly found myself hook, even told my sister about this game.",4
yes I would get this free game if you like backgammon. good features and view.  2 works finelots of fun,4
I have played a lot of Gannon on computers best challenge and realistic game ever played. Would recommend to any Gannon player .,5
"Well, it finally download, by itself, maybe that is normal, whatever, I am having fun and that is the main thing.It is worth it. Enjoy it too.",5
[[ASIN:B004DM1OAQ Backgammon Free]The game is entertaining and keeps you busy for as long as you want. I was surprise of the difficultly and challenge. If you enjoy playing backgammon this is for you. I recommend this game for kids over 9 years old and up.,4
Backgammon for kindle. Nothing special. Graphics are ok. If you really like backgammon you'll probably like this app. Again something to play while your bored.,3
"similar game to acey duecey. I  gave it a try and liked it. Not as fun as acey duecey, but very close. it does show you what moves are available for you to move, so it simplifies it if you are new.",4
I use on my tablet.  Very fast play with the touchscreen.  5 levels of difficulty along with other game options,5
"I forgot how much I enjoyed backgammon and now can play whenever I want even if there is nobody else around. But when bearing off it rolls high doubles WAY too often, statistically unlikely. But hey it was FREE!",4
"Great game. AI levels accurate level 5 makes no mistakes and is a great teacher. set up backwards complaints?  I either found the right options or an update fixed it. Computer weighted toward the AI? I don't think so it is just easier to notice when the AI gets a good role. Using this game, playing on 5 I have greatly increased my ability.",5
I just love this game.  Sometimes I do not know what the computer is doing.  Backgammon is truly a mind challenge.,5
"Only because I can't figure how to play! My daughter in law loves it! So, I keep it on my tablet for her!",2
"while the graphics and play in the game are great, I agree with another reviewer that there is definitely something wrong with the dice.  I rolled 8 doubles in one game!  the computer rolled none. The bug was in my favor, this time....",3
Fun and frustrating...great game that allows different levels of play. Recommend for the novice and the well versed. My only complaint is the doubling cube can only be played before rolling,4
"I do enjoy the speed of the play.  It has smaller graphics which makes it a little harder to see (old eyes) and it plays opposite of what you normally find which makes it a little confusing I think.  However, for free, that is a great deal.",3
"Not having played backgammon for many years, I began on the easiest setting. Three fast games in, I was hooked, and have found that the levels become decidedly more challenging. An intuitive and engaging experience.",4
Not a bad game. It does seem the computer gets an unlikely number of doubles in succession. Still a pretty good app as it meets my needs. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a casual game or making the time pass.,4
"I like this game but as difficulty is increased so is the probability that dice roles will benefit the AI.  Difficulty is increased by the computer's ability to get the exact roll that will capture any open game piece.  Your rolls,  on the other hand, are increasingly likely to force leaving a piece open to deny your ability to cover spaces.  I'm sure that programming an AI to &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; is difficult but manipulating the dice roll as a solution is infuriating.  Also, as a general rule, if the AI asks to double, resign the game. I play the game frequently but more often than not (on the higher levels least) I will quit the game out of frustration.",3
I see that there are some hardcore backgammon players out there!  And bless your hearts; but this is fun for the average person who simply enjoys the game.,5
its a very exciting gameboard to play. I just wish that it can be capable to allow for us to play with real people rather than the computer which is very predictable.  I would have given a four star instead.,3
I really like playing backgammon and this is an easy version to play.  You can learn how to play with the helpful hints that the game shows you.,5
The app works well and you can change difficulty.  Its a  fun game for backgammon fans.  Give this one a try its free,5
"No details were spared in the making of this free app.  If you like Backgammon, you will love this game!",5
This app is well worth your time. It is very easy to play. The AI plays a good game at thehigher levels. Worth your time.,5
"I enjoy this game, it is that for passing time. It is very easy to use and the graphics are great.",5
This is a great backgammon game. I like that you have the option of playing against the computer instead of just online. The only small complaint I have is that while playing your turn the game shows you all of your options.,4
"I play this game a lot.  It had a nice, clean interface and simple, straight-forward game play.  You can set a variety of game preferences, I don't usually play with these much.  All in all, I like it just to play Backgammon while killing time.",4
"Great game, no problems.  Can't always find someone to play with, so this is a nice alternative. I like that you can change the difficulty level for a challenge. The graphics are nice too.",5
Plays smoothly. A terrific game ... and the price is right! Many options and challenging levels. AI is strong! Good value.,5
The graphics are very good and the action much quicker than others I have tried.Nice job of programming.Thanks,5
"Simple, enjoyable app for playing backgammon, with several nice feature, as noted.  It does seem like it cheats a bit when rolling against me (but then I think all of my opponents do that when they beat me!)  It's a game ... just enjoy it!",4
I enjoy this game a lot. It has been somewhat challenging and I'm still experiencing some more challenging matches which I am looking forward to. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who is a beginner and for those who have more experience playing.,4
"I love to play Backgammon and this app is delightful and free.  It is easy and has directions if you need them.  It does have some ads but not many.  I highly recommend, I also have this app on my Eee pad, a great app!!",5
"The game is best if played at the highest difficulty, anything less is no challenge at all.I recommend with some reservations.",4
"I'm a backgammon nut, I will admitt that the computer seems to have the advantage and seem to always throught the right dice about 99% of the time in it's favor but I still love playing it.",3
I like this game.It's a great relaxing time waster. I like that I can play it offline and without a live opponent. I can leave it and return to it at my own pace.,4
"Plays very well on Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Very intuitive interface. Multiple options for match length  Can play with 2 human players using the app just as a game board. Even in this free version, the adds are not bothersome.  Nice game",4
"I have always liked backgammon but this keeps me up at night playing, so watch out or you may also become hooked.",5
I have seen other reviews about poor gameplay and too many doubles for the computer.  I find this to be the opposite.  The computer does as well as can be expected.  I have no feeling that die rolls are better for the computer either.  The only stupid move the cmoputer makes is accepting a double when they very littel chance of winning.  This does make winning a match easier.  Just don't offer doubles in stupid situations and you can control that result.,4
Grew up playing backgammon. This plays just like a live game! You can you use the gambling die if you want. You can get hints if you want. You can choose the level you would like to play at. Fun!,5
I like this product.  It reminds me of the one I have on my PC.  The computer always rolls more doubles than I do!!!,4
"I have played a lot of computer backgammon games and most of them seem to either cheat or just not play very well.  This one plays realistically. The other one that I saw on the Kindle apps looks like the same one that you can get on the Nook tablet. Don't buy that one, it plays really weird.  This one is much, much better.",5
"I play this game everyday, many times a day.  I enjoy the chase to finish first. It's a fast game when you have a few minutes to kill.",5
Works the way it should and plays just fine. Graphics are basic but who actually cares? (it's just backgammon!) .,4
Very entertaining. Enjoy the various levels of difficulty. Some reviews complain the CPU gets too many doubles. Balderdash. The game has an undo button to help you learn how to make better moves and in other games you get the majority of doubles. It balances out. Get the game. You'll love it.,5
nice to be able to travel with this game. fast smooth game play. if you're an avid backgammon player this doesn't offer much of a challenge but there is a 2 player mode,5
Awesome App!,5
"i like playing backgammon thanks Al Factory Limited for great games, I have several games app from al Factory limited",5
It also consistently rolls higher. Jip.Wont risk any amount on paid version no matter the cost. Cpu rolls incredible amount of doubles.,2
I love it. It's very addicting tho. I did not change any setting and have not had any issues with the computer player getting more doubles or any other issues.,4
This game really challenged me on the higher levels. I like being able to get good random rolls in my game set. Hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.,5
This app taught me how to play backgammon. I love it and play with this app a lot. I've become quite good at it.,5
It is fun to play. I can either play alone or with someone else. The best part about it is that it was free.,4
this is a great game to play if you enjoy playing it. Give it a fun try.  Loveing when the family wants to play.,5
"I have played a lot of backgammon games online. This one for Kindle is great! Quick smooth moves, excellent and is is FREE!.",5
like any board game you have to think of your next move.  can be tricky.  running about even playing against the machine.,4
great game fun to play hours of solo fun or multiplayer fun for all ages. for a free game this is awesome.,5
Great game but why set it up so you're on the opposite side of board? A bit odd but still playable if you enjoy backgammon.,3
Enjoying this old favorite again. Thank you for a fun past time! The action is smooth and the highlights are great for newer players.,5
"I've tried this game at several sites,but I enjoy backgammon free. I set the level and I set the length of the match.",4
I love this game. good time killer. seems fair against the computer. all the same old rules I really like this app.,5
"This is a great version of backgammon. It's free and easy to understand. The graphics as good, no need to pay for an app.",5
"Plays ok but the doubles come up a bit too often, good graphics, pleasant enough,  why it couldn't be fairer",5
"Have played this game on a variety of platforms for some time. Have seen it's strategies evolve over time. Share suspicions about CPU cheating - every now and then CPU goes on a tear - lots of doubles and always rolls something to hit me. Still, a nice diversion.",5
good learning tool  many levels of difficulty you can play with someone or with the computer enjoyable many hours of fun,4
"This is a very fun game to play whenever I have a few minutes to kill.  Just like the board game, so if you like the board game, you'll like this.",5
This game never played correctly. I installed it several times and it still would not play on my Toshiba Tablet.,1
"Having played backgammon on my laptop, I really was not impressed with this one.Found it hard to follow. Needless to say i have deleted it from my kindle fire",2
"This is fun when you only have a short time to play a game.  A little fast, but fun.  Worth downloading.",4
Play it frequently.  Like that you can up your skill level - or not. Great way to pass the time in a waiting room if you forgot your &#34;waiting room book&#34;.,5
Been looking for this game so I could play it on my kindle.  Very happy I have it.  Enjoying playing it.,5
I'm at level 5 and appreciate the computer partner.  Very challenging to win and feels like you've accomplished something when you do.,5
Very  addictive and loads of fun....I found myself losing time playing.....And my children really enjoyed playing also...I had to set the timer for them to share,4
fairly easy to use and understand directions. Minimal special features. Straight backgammon no ace deuce feature. However not a bad deal for free,3
"Overall I think this is a good game. I agree with other comments about how it seems the computer gets more doubles than I, but the handy built in stats screen shows that both players get on average the same number of doubles. What I find annoying is that the computer seems to get more favourable rolls than I do. That is to say that I seem to sit on the bench longer if a guy is captured than the computer does. Ifyour losing to poorly though you can undo and change your moves knowing you both will still get the same rolls.  Like I said I like it overall, and for free who am I to complain?",4
"This game is good to learn the game of backgammon. The undo button allows you to re evaluate your moves to improve your skills. I also like that I can turn on or off the ""show possible moves"" feature. I played with the feature on to learn the game and now have turned it off to test my skills.",4
easy to difficult modes. can even play using your own real dice. fast animation and helpful indicators as to which chips you can play based on dice roll. i recommend this game. nice price at free with ads.,4
"i grew up playing the board game. i really like this app, the only thing i would change is to be able to turn off the hints. other than that i'm very happy with it.",5
I've always enjoyed playing backgammon. Now I'm able to play anytime I want with this app. I like the different skill levels and am working up to winning the more advanced levels.,5
Cheats on higher levels worse than Tim Gitner on his taxes. Always gets the perfect roll or doubles just when the cpu needs it.,3
Many options to customise the way it plays.ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE TRIEDI ALSO LIKE THEIR OTHER GAMES ESPECIALLY GIN,5
"This backgammon game plays exactly the board game, so it is a perfect companion to those who want the challenge of backgammon on their Android device.  Excellent game play.",5
This game is awesome. No bugs. Runs great. No mistakes in game play. It runs great on my ZTE Warp.,5
I have always loved playing backgammon and since I rarely have human opponents have often played with computers  this game works well with my kindle fire and I like being able to select the difficulty level.,5
LOVE IT!!  I am addicted to this game.  I play it constantly.  It is so much fun and I just love it.,5
"Haven't had any issues, pleasant interface, and easy to play.  Runs smoothly and is a lot of fun.  Good replacement for my Hoyle game I miss so dearly on my PC!",4
"What can I say? I play it when I get bored. Usually never win, but it's fun to try to win.",3
One of the best free games I&acute;ve come across. It does cheat at the higher levels but the undo button makes it even.... over all a great game.,5
"I've enjoyed the game since downloading it to my Kindle. I gave my traveling game to my G-D last year, so I was glad to find this, especially free! ;-) All I need now is to find a good level that challenges.",4
"Easy to play, lifetime to master. Watch out though, the computer will always get the number it needs to put you onthe bar!",5
"I have tried several backgammon games and this is the best by far!!!!!!!!!  No questions asked, don't even bothering trying any others.  If you own any Apple products and want a good backgammon game, I feel sorry for you because Apple doesn't have this version.  All of their version can't compare.  There are a lot of comments about this game cheating, I don't have that problem and I beat the game frequently on the most advanced level. Love the speednof the game too.",5
I have been really enjoying playing this.  I haven't played in a long time and this is great.  You can play with someone else or the computer.  I enjoy the AI games.,5
"Looking for a great version of Backgammon, here it is!  I've tried a few different versions, but this one is the one to get.  Lots of options, can adjust competetion for a good game.  The ads don't get in the way, but might pay for it anyway since it is well worth the 99 cents.",5
fun game- you do have to know backgammon in order to play- it may take a couple of tries before it comes back to you---no cheating with the machine,4
"let's face it, who doesn't love backgammon!  i love this game & play it often.  can you do it w/ other players though?  i'm not sure but that would be fun!",5
I've had this game for some time. It works good on Kindle Fire HD. Best of all it's free. It's a lot of fun if you like backgammon.,5
"I know they say that the game can't be fixed, but when the computer consistently rolls multiple doubles, it does give one pause. The game can be a lot of fun, if you have a high tolerance for frustration.",4
"I bought this for my fire. It was free :-) Now, I can't seem to put it down. I may have to soon, though, because I am playing the game at its highest level, and I am starting to win more often than not.A note: the game seems to give more doubles and favorable rolls to the opponent. The makers assure that the random number generator is really random, and they even offer a roll-your-own option for dice. But doesn't it always seem that you are getting worse rolls when you are losing. (Probably why you are losing).The two player feature would be a good option for plane trips and the like, when you don't want to risk loosing pieces.",5
"It  is a good way to pass the time and it is nice to have a 2 person choice, so you can play with some one else on the same device.",4
"Excellent customization. Play black or white, inward or outward, with or without doubles, with or without Crawford's rule, 5 levels of AI with fast or slow graphic animations; check game win stats for each AI level and die totals, doubles at the end of each set.User interface is great. There are places it can be tweaked, eg maybe an option to switch sides for Roll and Double.CONS: The appstore does not allow rating this app 6 stars.",5
Very addicting and easy game play.  Who needs a real person when you have this wonderful game?  So far my favorite!,5
"I really enjoyed this game. The single player mode has decent AI to play with, and two player is fun with a friend. Part of a great series of table top game apps, I highly recommend them!",5
Another good app for kids and or beginners. I loved it and play it often. I was surprised considering it was free.,4
I enjoy playing backgammon. The game is excellent for all ages.  I have it on my first Kindle. The game is addictive.,5
"I have been playing Backgammon for 30 years, and I love playing it. Beware though it can be very addicting.",5
I enjoy the game of backgammon and have a hard to find an opponent. This game gives me a chance to play. The program plays a good game and I can beat it on occasion.  I recommend it highly.,4
"It's a decent game. As all free apps are, the commercials are aggravating. It isn't truly a random dice roll for the computer. If you leave a piece open, 9 times out of 10 the computer will roll exactly what is needed to cover your piece and send you back and the computer rolls an inordinate amount of high doubles, making it tough to beat. At least there is an undo feature so you can change your previous move at times.",4
"Like any other Backgammon app, this one increases the difficulty by tweaking the rolls to favor the computer. But it has some nice features for beginners.  You can take your move back even if the computer has already moved. It shows you which pieces are available to move, and where they can move, if you want it to. You can choose single games or matches with or without doubling.You can play against other people if you want to. For advanced players, this would be a convenient way to do that, but advanced players will not be challenged by the solo play. I'm advanced-beginner level and win most games at the highest level.",4
"I am a former tournament level backgammon player and enjoy this fast paced version of the game.  I keep track of my statistics and do see that the opponent gets more doubles which can be frustrating but since I consistently win more games and matches playing at the 5th level, I have to say that the game is created to let skill trump luck.  It would be a good game for novices to learn the game as well.  It's five levels give people a chance to compete at any level.",4
Great to play with computer or friend.  No longer have to keep a set in the car or remember to bring it with me.  Always can play.,5
"I really like this backgammon game!  It's great to play against the computer and I love that it allows me to play against another live person (as long as they're sitting beside me!)  The computer player is pretty good, but will make a silly mistake now and then.  It's better than the PC Windows version by far.  There are also options allowing you to choose the difficulty level, and other options.  Highly recommend and it's FREE!",5
"I got this download for my grandson. he is usually interested in puzzles, but this one he just tried a couple moves and went to a differant app",2
I like it because I like to do word search puzzles. I find it challenging. I have downloaded many others,4
"So, another good buy on the Amazon special of a game that has good reviews (or better).  Hoping to enjoy it on my android as so many others have.  You can never have too many games.",5
"Nice little word search game. My mom always plays this type of game. It doesn't take a big time investment, but she likes finding all the words and the color themes makes it more visually interesting. Just slide your finger across the screen to highlight your word.  You can pick the word categories you want to work with or make up your own. You can even add your own words. I played it for about 20 minutes and it seemed very easy. I think it would be best for kids or senior citizens. Works well on Kindle Fire.",4
This is a lot of fun. The letters are nice and big. It highlights the letters in different colors. So if you are looking for a word search game. Then you should get this app.,5
It works well enough but it's very easy to solve and ultimately quite boring. But it's free so its certainly worth the price.,2
"WAS AN OK GAME.  THERE ARE SOME OTHER BETTER WORD SEARCH GAMES OUT THERE TO DOWNLOAD.  I GUESS, I'D GIVE IT C+.",3
"loved this game so glad to see more games for the fire.Fun, made me think, a good game for teens and young adults.",5
This little game has become an addictive favorite of mine. Great when my wife is driving and I need to occupy myself.,5
"I also use word search in my limited but spear time good brain teaser.  I've also turned my granddaughter on to searching for words, and she likes it.  Keeps her busy on trips.  I recommend it for all ages.",5
"My son and I love this game, its and it passes the time pretty fast. Would like for it to be a little bit more kid friendly though.",5
"Simple and easy, great when you just want a mindless game to pass the time and don't want to think too much or get too involved.  Helps to keep my mind sharpe and focused; fun to play.",5
"The game itself is a little to easy.It's a quick easy time killer for when you don't have alot of time to kill, but you don't want to stare at the walls for 5 or 10 minutes. The graphics and physics are about par with this type of game. Some people may find the game boring because no death, destruction or mayhem occur in this game. It's straight up no frills vocabulary word search.You can't beat the price=FREE!!!This app has the following addons.Adware: AdSenseAnalytics: Google AnalyticsDeveloper Tools: noneSocial Gaming: noneReviewed on a Galaxy S2 Skyrocket 1.5 GHz dual core cpu, 1GB ram, 4.5&quot; screen and Gingerbread 2.3.6 OS.",4
"I love word search puzzles so i figured i would give this one a try. It is another one of those games that are good for children, but is entirely way too simple and small for adults that like to really use their brain.",2
I've being playing this ancient game all my life (65+ years).  I love this electronic version especially when I win over the computer.,5
"This is an excellent backgammon game. The game I played before this one, played poorly, even on the most difficult setting. This is a well programmed game, although sometimes it gives itself a few extra doubles. I would recommend it for high level players.",5
My husband and I play every day before he goes to work. I can't wait to teach the kids. This may become our family game night game.,5
"I really like backgammon,but not this.downloaded it,then turned off my WiFi to play.I immediately got an error screen.I checked permissions and it said external storage.then why wouldn't it play?if you have to be on line to play a game as a single player,then that's a red flag.you should be able to play against the computer off line.if you want multiplayer,then go on line if you want to risk your privacy.I won't.",1
"Used to play on a real board when i was young, had forgotten all about it, till I got the app. I'm a little rusty, but I am improving.",4
"AI makes some strange choices at times but overall a very fun game to play, especially if you're into backgammon",5
"This is a very well done backgammon boardgame, I love playing it and have no complaints, overall really well done",5
Great way to challenge one's skills at playing backgammon. Can be addictive but great way to fill time when traveling.,5
"Great version of an old classic! Love playing by self, although sometimes it is a very difficult win! Makes it more interesting!",5
Been years since I played Backgammon. My daughter told me about it being a free app on Amazon so I downloaded it. It is fun to play.,5
"I played the free version for a year before finally springing for the ad-free version.  Out of all of the ones I played, I like the setup and the UI compared to the others I tried (and I tried lots).  There are multiple different options on how you want to play and it makes it for a more interesting game.",5
"This game has nice graphics, five (supposed) levels of play, and convenient player cues when  making moves.What it does NOT have is an AI which knows anything about basic backgammon strategy. That makes the five levels of difficulty not really be five levels of difficulty, because the game plays the same flawed strategies at each of the five levels.In fact, I've played several computer backgammon games over the last 25 or so years, and this is unquestionably the worst AI I've yet seen.In particular, it doesn't have a clue how to best run to the inner table or how to roll off. Two games in a row when I was hopelessly out-pipped (as the AI had already rolled more doubles than odds make credible) the AI simply chose the least efficient method of filling the inner table and then rolling off. At times it will move up men on the inner table when rolling off instead of taking two men off of lower points.It will ""arrange"" the inner table when there are still men to bring there. In one game at the ""highest"" difficulty, the AI had all but two men in the inner table, and needed 12 pips to bring those to the inner table. I had three men outside the inner table and needed more than 20 pips. On two turns in a row it ""arranged the inner table"" instead of advancing the last two men. In the meantime I brought all three of my men to the inner table, and actually rolled off my first pair before it brought in its last two.In another game both the AI and I had all our men in the inner table, and his array was much more balanced, as I was piled up on 5 and 6. On a few turns the AI moved men up from its 5 and 6 instead of taking men off of 2 and 3. When it later rolled 5s and 6s they were wasted. I won that game without doubles, and I should have needed both double 5s and double 6s to win.This game, as do most computer backgammon games I've played, seems to roll doubles for itself at an unlikely high rate. Also, be prepared that most useful game opening rolls are going to be ""won"" by the AI. LOL But the AI is so clueless that it doesn't really do it any good. Note that the game will also at times accept hopeless doubles, but that is not uncommon for backgammon AIs. The only games it won were games where it considerably out-rolled me, like 40 to 50 pips worth.I played this on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 without any technical issues.Recommended if you don't want a challenge, otherwise look elsewhere.",2
"Been using the free version for years now and was very excited to see the paid version as the FAOTD. I'd recommend the game to any fan of backgammon without reservation. However, I was very disappointed to discover after installing it that my stats from 1000+ games played in the free version weren't imported into the paid version, starting me out at ground zero. I know it seems trivial, but in an app where stats are collected it seems almost a given that the stats should carry over when you like an app enough to pay to move from the free version. I've got enough time invested in the free version that in many ways it seems more attractive to put up with the occasional ad and keep my stats than to start over again ad-free. Gotta knock off a star for this oversight.In all other respects, this is a five-star app. If you're not coming from the free version (or don't mind losing your stats if you are), consider this a five-star review and invest (if you missed getting it as the FAOTD) without reservation.",4
"Would have gotten a full five stars but sometimes, the game decides you have to make a particular play even when another play is available. I'm not talking about &#34;bearing off&#34; there's an order to that, but when I have three five point moves and the game only allows one of them... well, it doesn't happen often but enough to cost you a star.",4
seems like it cheats on the opening role however. The AI wins that roll about 95% of the time. Otherwise it plays well and is a lot of fun.,4
I like backgammon and it's fun to play against the computer because you are trying to outwit it.  I haven't played it enough yet to give a thorough review.,3
Love this game as it does not require more coins to continue playing. Plus I like the game of backgammon.,5
"All I can say is WOW! A very good make of backgammon for on the go with excellent graphics and animations with nothing annoying popping up at all. Oh I almost forgot the computer does not, I repeat does not cheat.",5
"So much fun, but you can almost guarantee the AI will get doubles like crazy at the end if they're getting their butt kicked.  The doubles even out over the long run, but it sure feels like it is cheating on occasion, just like the real game!",5
"Step up just like a game but except I do not know what I am doing ,if I knew how to play backgammon or remember how I am sure I would like it more",4
It is almost like really playing the real board game.It does have some settings to set the play.I would recommend this game.,4
You can get lost for hours with this game. This is the type of game you end up talking to.,5
"Very good game of the almost very best developer. This is well known game in so many variants, excellent music and graphic, which will not disturbe your concentration. All of that in less then 4MB, single and multipleyer. I recommend it.",5
"Good graphics and easy to play. The  A.I. is dumb at the easy setting, which was good to play and win, but is challenging if you make it so with increased difficulty settings.  I like winning and like the ability to learn the correct moves and yet can increase my strategy for competing as I get comfortable with the game.  Recommend this developer for other games they make....",4
This is a great little app. They did a nice job with it and it works well. If you like backgammon then I'd highly recommend it.,5
This is a game that you have to use your logic to out maneuver your opponent . I like it well,5
"Having played a backgammon game on my wife's iPad (and beating it like a rented mule), I was a bit wary of trying one on the Kindle. This one, however, was quite excellent.The different levels of play enable a person to improve their game. The usage of the doubling cube by the AI is quite good (it does know when it has the advantage and also realizes when it is beaten). The graphics are pleasant and the ease of usage is very good.If you're looking for a good quality backgammon game - and not something that you can beat easily - this one's for you.",5
I love that I can play the machine and there are different levels. Great graphics.  It's easy to open and shut down.  Good game.,5
This game has excellent artificial intelligence. My wife and I play a game or two of backgammon daily on the Kindle. This application shows you how to play and is aesthetically pleasing and great fun!,5
"This is a faithful and realistic implementation of a familiar board game.  I enjoy board games that I can play against the computer.  (I'm not into online games, or playing with others who I don't even know.  And I usually only have a very limited amount of time to play a game, so it has to be on my time, and whenever I like.)  This version of Backgammon plays a good game -- but not the kind where you will be beaten every time you play.  (I hate computer chess games, for example.)  Of course, it's still a game of change; your success depends, to a great extent, on the &#34;roll of the dice&#34; -- literally. But in this case, that roll seems pretty fair.  And with some careful playing, I tend to win more games than I lose -- which is fine with me.",5
"Learned to play this game as a child. Began playing again as an adult with &quot;Acey-Deucey&quot;. The graphics here are great. It's a lot of fun, and easy to play. I like that you can beat the computer opponent. It pays to check for the &quot;free app of the day&quot;!",5
I have been playing this game for a couple of months now and LOVE LOVE LOVE it! I would give it six stars if I could. I had never played Backgammon and within a few minutes I was up and running. The difficulty modes make it an excellent choice for beginners or old pros. I love that you can play single player (against the computer) or have a two player game. This has been my &#34;go to&#34; game from game one and I play it every single day.,5
Look and feel of real game. Levels if difficulty. Good way to learn how to play game. Ease of use.,4
"If you enjoy playing Backgammon, I recommend downloading this one, it can keep you entertained for hours on end.  I particularly like being able to choose the difficulty levels.  I don't really understand the &#34;doubling&#34; option that pops up from time to time, but you can turn that part off and not be bothered with it.  The computer is a good opponent even though some of its' moves don't always seem logical, it does give you a run for your money so to speak, and it plays fair.  The only improvement I would make on this game is to also offer the option of playing Acey-Duecy, but for the time-being I'm content with Backgammon.",5
I haven't played Backgammon for yrs ... was so excited about this download ...well worth the 99cents ... I couldn't be more pleased with an app.,5
I love these guys they never have a problem.I have a go game from them and chess they're both excellent this backgammon game is no exception they put everything in here that you need to play the game perfectly the AI is superb and the game is always just as fun as playing the real-life version if you love these kinds of games download it.,5
"I purchased this game already on my HTC INSPIRE phone from Google. It's well done, fair, altho the AI does seem to cheat sometimes. But that just makes it more challenging. And it is winnable. And sometimes in real life, the dice just doesn't go your way. If you enjoy backgammon, definitely worth the purchase. Downloaded here for my Kindle Fire HD. This company does do quality games, for sure, as I also have chess and checkers.",5
I know I will like this game once I get used to it.  I have only tried it a couple times without too much success as it has been many years since I played the board game.,4
"Fun, no crashes. The higher the level the more you will hear me yelling &#34;you cheated&#34; to the computer as the AI manages to eke out a win in the last few moves. I am improving though.",5
"I am not a very serious backgammon player, so I cannot speak to the quality of the AI. I do know that it can beat me on level 5 if I play irresponsibly. Of course, sometimes I get lucky. I do know enough about backgammon to know that ""luck"" usually favors the better player. Yes, the dice matter, but it is more about what you do with the rolls you get.I find it fascinating to read accusations that the game ""cheats."" I just played a game where I was way behind and rolled consecutive double 6s to get closer. I still lost, but I thought I would throw out this experience as evidence that the dice can come up with unusual rolls both ways.You just can't go too far wrong with the AI Factory games. I love their backgammon, checkers, and chess. I was thinking about buying this anyway, so I was very glad to get it as the FAOTD.",5
includes extra features like allowing real dice input and a great game to learn on since it shows you where you can move. Also allows you to turn that feature off. I recommend for the beginner or advanced player.,4
Is fun to play and realistic as well.  The dice moves &#34;are&#34; random which gives you a great game if set on the higher levels.,4
This game is a good fast moving game that combines attention to detail and fun.  It lets you make choice moves that can help or hinder you.,4
"I hadn't played backgammon in years and have enjoyed getting reacquainted with this terrific app! You can play 1 or 2 players, so I've even been able to teach my family members how to play. Highly recommend this one for backgammon lovers, and those who'd like to learn to play.",5
This is exactly what you expect. A nice simple backgammon game. I enjoy it. The computer seems to roll way to many doubles but it is still fun to play,4
"This review is for the free version.  Very nicely done implementation of backgammon, with fast and elegant interface, nice user controls, and good documentation.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the computer opponent seems to follow a flawed strategy with its end game in that it doesn't try to get its pieces off the board as soon as possible.  Also it seems slow to double when the game is winning and quick to accept doubles when I'm winning.  All in all, it's just challenging enough for me to make it interesting at level 5.As for the random dice generator, I don't agree that the computer cheats, but it doesn't seem to have a true uniform distribution (where each of the six sides of each die is equally likely).  In one of my first dozen games it gave me the same roll three turns in a row, and it does seem to roll an awful lot of doubles.",4
Any game by AI factory works well on the Kindle Fire HD. I buy them all because they work and are beautifully designed. These are just the best time wasters around.,5
"I like it. I've been a backgammon player since my youth playing on real boards and, eventually, the internet. (Anybody else remember using telnet to connect to FIBS?)Well this certainly looks a lot better than the old telnet days. :-)  The board and dice are very nicely designed, both the classic and modern skins. I played a couple games on the different difficulty levels, and I'd say there's enough range that anyone short of a world-class player is going to find a level that is challenging and rewarding.Pros:1. Looks great.2. Free App of the Day3. 5 difficulty levels to choose from. Should be sufficient for anyone from the beginner to the serious player.4. Well worth the 99 cents...but...FREE today!5. Almost no permissions. Other than writing to storage, this thing doesn't try to do anything. I have my WiFi off when testing games, and the Single Player works without a hitch.Cons:I can't think of any.Recommendation:Get it while it's the FAOTD if you can, but if you like backgammon, it's worth the 99 cents if you miss out on the freebie.",5
"Dice throws are clearly not entirely random, in that the opponent goes first probably 75 % of the time.  But fun to play and I recommend it as a freebee.",3
"The dice appear to be driven off a pre-seeded prng, since you can undo multiple rolls and then get exactly the same rolls again. That isn't technically buggy and they can legitimately claim to get a flat distribution over time, but it means players can cheat and therefore so can the computer.Secondly, the AI is defective. It's even worse than one I would write! That really REALLY needs fixing. Badly. It seems to have a lookahead of zero and a penchant for stacking everything on the last space. Either write a better AI (herustics, not fixed moves) or let it write its own (genetic algorithms).",3
i got this game in hopes that i could finally learn how to play the game but this version was not for that. they do poorly to excecute the rules and the design is just poor. there must be a better version out there. i deleted this one from my fire.,1
Chat options are too limited.  I would prefer to be able to select both dice rolls with just one click.  Would like to display my historical win lose statistics,4
This game is impossible to play.  Ive tried changing the settings but it dont work.  I love playing rl back gammon sobthis was a big dissapointment,1
Fun game to play when you have no one to play against.  The opponent is predictable after a few games though.,4
I used to sit and play Backgammon with a couple friends for hours on end. Since I moved I haven't found anyone interested in learning to play. I was pleased to find this Backgammon app. The graphics are well done. The sounds and animation are pleasant and it doesn't seem to 'cheat' in the game's favor on the dice rolls. It would be nice if there were more color options for the board and pieces but other than that I've spent hours enjoying this game.,5
"I started playing backgammon in college nearly 40 years ago. In fact, I got pretty good; winning several championship tournaments. But, that, was a long time ago. I didn't remember how to play until I got this program for my kindle fire. I like it because it comes with different levels of play as well as instructions! I am now working my way up the levels and have begun sparring with the game's computer. I'm not ready for tournaments at the local assisted-living facility, yet!  But soon!!!!",5
This is one of my go-to game apps when I want to destress and clear the mind chatter.  The game is easy and you can play with as much strategy as you prefer.  Good graphics and nice play.,5
I crank up the difficulty and win very few initial rolls.  Also my rolls are low throughout the game.  If I put the computer in the center then it always rolls the right number to put mine in the center.  Seems kind of fishy.,2
I would love it but it's not yet there. Maybe with a few updates that make it look and run a little smoother.,4
"I played the free version for a long time.  Not sure what the difference is between the free and this version, but they are both equally fun.",5
"This is a typical backgammon game.  I got it because I like to play backgammon.  I tried playing it on my phone, but I guess my fingers are too fat, I had a hard time touching the pieces to move them.  After a game I gave up on this.  It is really not a limitation of the game, more than likely it's my phone. I think on a tablet it would work much better.",4
"fun, easy..I like it. It works like a game should. I would recommend it to others.....I like their other games as well.",5
"It is a good game, well designed and allows me to practice to keep my skills fresh when I play on the real boardwe have. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys backgammon.",5
"This is a good game for playing by yourself or passing the kindle back and forth.  Some other reviews mentioned showing the possible moves takes the skill out but I found that you could easily turn that part off so use it or not as you prefer.  I keep it turned on with playing with kids because it does speed things up if they don't have to count out each move, lol.",5
"I love this game. I use almost every day. It also works as a good teaching tool for children. As you get better, you move up to higher levels.",5
"I like putting my mind to work, I love a challenge even thou the way I learned to play Backgammon is a little different I still like it . I have always liked Backgammon years ago. I had not seen the game for a long, and O'BOY when I saw the free Amazon app of the day was Backgammon I got so excited!! I still like Backgammon. Thanks You  Amazon!",4
This board is upside down!  It's so annoying. I want to bear off on the bottom right not the top right.  The whole thing is backwards!  I deleted after ONE game.,1
"The AI has some serious strategy problems.  In the last game I played, it had all its remaining pieced on 1 and 2, and rolled double ones.  It should have removed 4 from the board, but instead moved 4 from the 2 position, to the 1 position.  Stupid.  Making up for this deficiency, the computer gets better rolls.  It doesn't get more doubles, but it gets higher totals, and usually gets exactly what it needs.  Still fun, but still flawed.",3
"I didn't know how to play backgammon until I downloaded this game.  And now, I'm addicted, of course.The graphics are great, the menu options simple to understand, the gameplay is smooth.  Rarely nags for ads and keeps track of your wins.  I play this every day, love it!",5
"Easy to use and fun haven't played to many times, but have won each time so not sure if it's being nice to me and then coming in for the kill. We will see!",5
"I play this app whenever I need a break or have a few spare minutes.  I don't understand some of it's moves and the dice rolls always seem to favor the computer in some situations, but the price was right.",4
The authors say the  rolls are random but if you play long enough and you see the computer player roll doubles with 4 pips left on the board when you have only one to play off you might get a little suspicious.  Happens way to often,2
"The fact that the game even has an option for manual dice entry should have been a clue .After about 2 dozen games and looking at the the statistics ... there was only one match where I got more doubles and it was still a close match. The tremainder of those matches... the AI easily got 3-5 times as many doubles. While statically possible, I find improbable.Uninstalled....",2
This game is great! I have played this for years with my family and now I can play with any level player I want and when I want.,5
Backgammon is all about doubling and probable rolls of the dice...This is fast and great play.  A well designed app on my KFire. Trying to figure the algorithm for the computer to accept or decline the double has made solo play funner....I want a job at the AI Factory... $90k@300k valuation with 250k line of credit@6% paid when net positive revenue.  And the whole game is under 4mb...another plus for the IPO.  Who would-of Thunk- you'd make your momma so proud?  Bravo... Lawson di Ransom Canyon.  9-2013,5
"I really enjoy backgammon and this game knows how to move!  No dawdling. TYVM for the free game, I'm grateful",5
"Nice game so far.  Plays through quickly because it shows you your possible moves.  I hope to find a setting to turn that function off.  If you are just learning to play it's a great feature.  But if you already know how, it seems to take away some of the challange.",4
"I love playing, and I already had one game when this one came up. This one is so much better that I only play this one now. If you try it you will love it too!",5
I am not very good at this game & get frustrated sometimes but I do enjoy it & hope to improve my game.,4
Its like playing with a real person. Keeps me engaged and challenged. There is also option for two players. Quite enjoyable.,5
The difficulty levels and options are very good.  Smooth working - no complaints.  Good backgammon game.  (Why does Amazon require a minimum number of words in a review?),4
Works very well on my Cruz T408 and T508 tablets.  And also on my OLD smart phone from 4 years ago.,5
Great game with different skill levels.  I like it.,5
I always wanted to learn how to play Backgammon. I play it at least once a day. I love it.,5
"It is totally slanted in favor of the computer oponent.  I play at the hardest board and doubles are rolled constantly by the computer opponent and I had zero doubles. also on opening roll, the &#34;good&#34; rolls, ie 4/6 3/5 6/5 etc are always ALWAYS given to the computer opponent........no random play of the dice ever, and when you use the doubling cube and it appears that you have a slam dunk at winning, all of a sudden, double after double on the dice shows up when it is the opponents play......really a waste of time, takes the fun out of playing by not having a random dice play,  awful........dont waste time or money,",1
"This is a great backgammon app. I love it.  the paid and free versions are basically the same, the only difference is the free version has in app advertisements.  I would recommend the paid (0.99) version, just to eliminate the ads.  In a nutshell a great app!",5
"I'm thrilled to have a backgammon game to play that requires no human partner. Aside from the fact that I don't even know anyone who wants to play the game, the invisible computer is way faster than a human. And, the AI opponent doesn't get its circuits in a bunch if you put them on the bar repeatedly. The moves available light up, and that sure makes things easy on the eyes. Since I haven't played in a while, this is a great way to get reacquainted with the game and start working my way up the difficulty levels. Lots of fun to play for 5 minutes or an hour!",5
"I picked this up a few days ago as another FAOTD (thank you, again, Amazon!).  I've always wanted to learn to play Backgammon, and though this app isn't really designed to &#34;teach&#34; it, it makes it very easy to learn.  The graphics are good, and the game play is quick.  There are several options that can affect the duration of a &#34;match.&#34;  You can have a quick one-game match, or you can play to 15 points, requiring several &#34;games.&#34;  After playing this, I'm ready to buy my first real Backgammon set (from Amazon, of course!).",5
"Very user friendly! I love to play backgammon but have found other computer versions would allow the computer to win 99% of the time, which was very frustrating. I have to say, I have out played the computer the majority of the time and if the computer wins, it is fair and square. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD and love, love, LOVE it!",5
Used to carry a travel backgammon set with me.  No more!  No pieces to drop and lose!  this game has a variety of options and you can even use your own dice--though why is beyond me.,5
Tends to make poor moves.  Otherwise very nice user interface with rapid and easy play.  Could eliminate dice rolls when no entry move exists.,4
Dice certainly seemed to be slanted toward the computer expecially with the doubles.  It becomes a real expected roll of doubles exactly when needed for the computer not for the player.,3
"Great gamepasses the test of timeMinimal permissionSmallWorks on Samsung Note 10.1 tablet, no bugs that I can see",5
Purchased for Kindle Fire and works great.  Difficulty level scales appropriately.  Animations and piece movement are well done and easy to use.,4
"Game is good for beginners and seasoned players.  It has modes that allow you to play without move tips and for newer players, has one that shows what the right moves would be.  Only improvement I can think of would be a ""forfeit"" option for those games where my butt is getting kicked :)",4
"The more I played this game, the more often the Ai opponent started rolling doubles nearly every single roll!!! How can you compete with that?? And not only that, the doubles were the number it could use the most to maximize moves towards a win! I'm sorry to say, but I honestly believe there is a flaw in the game that favors the device when in single player mode. If the rolls were more random, or the gameplay were more 'fair', It would definately get a higher score from me, but not the way it is. Also, one othe thing a LOT OF DEVELOPERS IGNORE ; AN EXIT BUTTON!!!!!!!  I'm not a developer/programmer, but how hard can it be? Too bad about all this, I love Backgammon!I read some of the other reviews and most people (as I do) that the dice are loaded. The roll should be as random as you can possibly make them concidering the limitations of programming. The differences should be where the AI decides to move the game pieces, leaving more open, or not, depending on the level. The dice rolls should ALWAYS BE RANDOM and have the same probability for both players. This would be the way it happens in real life with two people playing a real game. If the game ever gets updated to reflect better play conditions, my rating will go up.",2
"PLAY THIS AT LEAST ONCE EVERY DAY!  Because of this particular backgammon game, I have learned to be an excellent backgammon player.  I never understood the game; now I'm addicted to it!",5
I really like this game and it was free!  Can't beat that.  Plays very fast and well.  I like that you can do single player against the computer.,5
"no problems, loaded great, User friendly, enjoyable.  Nice graphics, no extra mps to load, uses doubling cube if you choose.",5
"I love playing backgammon on the computer; however, the Al Factory Limited Backgammon is slow and cumbersome to play.  I relish a fast paced game and one that only requires one click to move a tile.  This version is okay in a pinch, but not something I would look forward to playing daily.",3
"Maybe I am just not into the game any longer, but I do not find it very challenging.I guess there are too many other games available to choose from.",3
"Comp rolled double 5s then two double 6s in a row while I was rolling 1s and 2s to make 3.  With the best strat in the world it is impossible to beat that.  Nock his piece onto the bar, every time he rolls the exact number he needs to knock any of your uncovered pieces onto the bar in return. Undo to see if there is a way to cover... nope. Game just feels cheap.  Comp rolled 6 doubles in a single game to my 1.  This is common mind you.  Game is less fun when you feel like it cheats.",1
"This game HAD to have been programmed by someone who has never played backgammon. Opening rolls are about the only thing that follows what you might expect.  There are times it will hit every possible blot, and then other times, will not hit a blot that would be to it's advantage. The end game is ridiculous. The program wants to want to move all men to the home point FIRST - even if there are men that could be taken off a higher point. Unless I play with the doubling cube, I can easily beat the program 98% of the time at the top level. Graphics are very good, the game keeps better statistics statistics, the available moves are highlighted, and even the sound of the men 'shooshing' as they are moved are all pluses.In comparison to the Compulab game on my Kindle keyboard, no contest!But I wanted Backgammon for the Fire HD.....................Three months later.I am much more satisfied with the HD backgammon at this point. There is the feature that allows you to ""undo"" a move, because the touch screen can be somewhat sensitive. But you can ""undo"" all the way back to the beginning. I'll do that to see if a specific move was where the game fell apart. I still find the end game irritating. The statistics allow you to look at how many spaces could be moved, and the number of doubles in the game. After a total of over 700 games played on all levels, I moved my review up one star to four.",4
"I get so lost in this game my bus ride goes very quickly, I like the sounds affects.. i like this game a lot",5
"This is the world's all time leading cheater.  I have been playing backgammon for over 60yrs,  more than 1,000,000 games at least.  Statistics show that if you leave a spire open this app will hit you 90 / percent of the time. If you play this game as much as I do you know the statistical average is around  35 percent.  And wait until you get to a roll off,  count on the machine getting 3-4 doubles. They even have a disclaimer telling you why they are not cheating. This game is no fun.Grampyz",1
"I love backgammon. The game does not cheat. It does seem that is is getting harder to beat the computer, which is a good thing.",5
This is a great game.  Like that you can choose from two different colors.  Like that ave different levels of difficulty.,5
"I used to have the free app, and was happy to see this one on faod. the game itself is simple to play, focusing on great ui rather than fancy graphics. Level of play ranges from easy to medium, if you are professional backgammon player it will probably be too easy for you. It is, however, a good range for most.In terms of permissions, this is another great app by ai factory, which means no spyware and no intrusive permissions. I have purchased several of their apps before and this is no bait and switch, their apps stay permission free",5
my mom used to have this game. brings back childhood memories. I play it AT LEAST once a day. love it.,5
"It's been a few years since I learned Backgammon, and I needed a refresher. Game didn't really give me a chance to learn before wiping the floor with me. Probably fine if you play regularly.",2
"I like the Backgammon app, but there are a few things that are quite annoying.  For example, when you roll doubles, you have no option to move two pieces at a time.  You have to make 4 separate moves, with each move involving at least 2 clicks.  that's 8 clicks for one move, which is too many.  Also, I started playing against the computer, with the difficulty set at 2.  Even though it's not the lowest setting, the computer played like a complete novice, passing up obvious moves in favor of idiotic ones.  Of course, this can be solved by simply setting the game at a higher difficulty, but it was still annoying.  I'll be looking for fixes in updates, so I haven't given up hope that this could become an outstanding app.",3
"This completes my collection of core AI Factory games.Without a doubt, this is simply the best Backgammon game available for the Android OS in existence.Pros:* Clean UI* No IAP* Fair (you can even use your own dice rolls)* Die roll statistics (so you can see it doesn't favor the AI)* Complete with ""How to Play"" for those new to this great game* Ample options (set up game play how you want, INCLUDING REVERSING THE BOARD*)* Intuitive* Once license is verified, you CAN play offlineCons:N/AWhether you know or like Backgammon, I highly suggest you add this game to your collection, you may find you play it more than any other, even if it's later.  You'll not regret owning the license.* To reverse the board, after you select ""Single Player,"" choose the dark piece (checker, pip, etc) in the ""Match Settings"" ""Play as:"" option.  To switch to white, in regular options, choose ""Invert Piece Colours."" This depends on who go first.",5
"great backgammon game. it is nice for the developer to offer a 'free' version (with ads) to try before buying. I played a few dozen games and really enjoyed it, so I think paying a dollar is worth it!",5
I enjoy playing the game again since I don't get to play locally. It works well and can be adjusted to your skill level.,4
very nice clean design and smooth game. it runs perfect ot my Samsung galaxy tab 10.1! u cam play vs a friend or a CPU with different levels of difficulties. only things missing is playing vs someone online,5
Great game with varying levels of difficulty.  Priced reasonably.,5
"It's quick, easy to learn and a straightforward version of the game. It's very professionally done. It was quite the bargain when it was offered as the free app of the day.",5
I really enjoy the ease of play on this game. the skill levels aid me in honing my skills for the next family gathering.,5
This reminds me of when I was hanging out with my girlfriends as a teenager and having fun playing backgammon.,4
This game is very bad. You just talk to a guy who doesn't understand a word your saying. Plus who cant even see anything. Do not get this app.,1
loving this game! just barely missed the original text based rpg's growing up.. and have always wanted to try them! best one I've tried so far!,4
"I have no experience with this type of game, but I gave it a try.  It was fun at first, but I don't think I know enough about this type of adventure to get the full experience.  That said, it's amazing how the app responds to your input...  and can be frustrating, too!",3
This is a well made text adventure game that will keep you thinking about you next move. Worth the download.,5
"For those old enough to remember games like this, enjoy!  The rest of you, welcome to a type of game that was all the rage when personal computers hit the scene.In this game you have to rely on your mind alone. Using a limited vocabulary, you navigate around the world and interact with it.  Find items to use, treasures to hoard, puzzles to solve, etc. It's an adventure, so the more you explore and discover, the more points you get.  Thankfully, you can pause the game and come back to it later when you need to, and can continue to play should your game self be killed (costs you points)If you're looking for flashy graphics and super fast gameplay, skip this one.",5
"The original text adventure game is back on android :)  :)  OK, I got this long before Amazon opened it's ap store.  It is one of the first things I went looking for when I got my tablet (an archos 70)... but I have not, yet been able to put it on my archos 5 because of lack of market access (I will try downloading to that device later now that Amzon has it, but it works fine on the archos 70!)Writing this review makes me feel old indeed.  I spent so many night awake until all hours of the night playing this on my dad's apple 2c back in 1975,6,7... it is a very rich game and one you will not finish in an hour or a day.  This is the game which spawned an entire genre (or 2 or 3): rpgs, text adventures, d & d sims... they all started here.So far this port seems very true to the original; at least I have not found a place where it deviates (but for the addition of voice control, if that is available/ enabled on your device).  I have not used that component (I would feel very odd sitting in a waiting room, e.g. and talking to my tablet) but the text component is true to the original.Colossal cave takes you on a grand adventure underground: dragons, pirates, and other slithery things :)  I would not want to spoil it for the uninitiated by giving a blow by blow.  I will just say that this is definitely worth downloading!  You can't get much more ""retro,"" as this is the first of its kind.  if you grew up with games which are heavy on the graphics... well you are missing something in terms of engaging your imagination.  Give this a try.  What have you got to lose? (other than hours and hours and hours.... heh heh heh).",5
"I played Colossal Cave (a.k.a. ""Adventure"") when it was first developed, back in the 1970s.  At the time, it was one of the most fascinating computer games available.  And its long life -- and the fact that I'm playing it again almost 40 years later -- support the fact that this is the greatest adventure game of all time.  There is a fascination with something that at first appears so simple, yet without ""awesome graphics"" or ""3-D whiz bangs"" or any other ""modern gaming devices"", and is still challenging and enjoyable.The game is implemented well, and I highly recommend it -- especially to younger players (by which I include anyone under about 35!) -- as a wonderful break from the fast and furious trigger-finger mindless destruction games that are so prevalent today.",5
Reminds me of the old adventure games I used to play on my TI 99-4A computer when I was a kid.  Not as fun though.  Kind of ridiculous you can get lost right off.  Made it pretty far into different areas (even captured bird) but quickly lost interest.  Quit playing after 1/2 hour and deleted.,2
Things brings me back to when I first starred playing computer games! Be aware there are no graphics just pesty dwarfs throwing deadly axes  lots of twisty paths. I completely enjoy engaging my brain to figure out how to maneuver the cave ATMs find all the treasure!,5
"I did not enjoy this so called game at all. it just bored me. I don't see how people play this for more than five mins,  that's all I could stand.",2
i looooove this app! my nesie and i will play this for hours strait at a time just to end up dieing in the tunnels from the little dwarf! that little guy freaks me out! i love the concept of the game and the tone of the writer... over all best app EVER GET IT!!!,5
"Don't get me wrong. This is a good game for those that completely love text based games. My problem is that the plot is so vague, it gets aggravating at time. Collect Treasure. That would be nice and all if I didn't get lost in the forest all the time. I know that it adds to the challenge but if and when I do want to leave, I get even more lost. Your &quot;guide&quot; needs a larger vocabulary because the words I am forced time and time again to use are so simple, I literally drop my Kindle Fire and stomp away in anger.",2
"As far as text adventures go - this is pretty frustrating. If it's complicated puzzles don't get you, the random holes that seem to appear in dark areas will. Or better yet, try getting out of the labyrinth while keeping your sanity. Maybe you should take the game's advice - or wait, don't because usually it doesn't work. What's worse is that it actually retorts when you finally tell it to **** off. Strange, difficult, and taunts the player. Decide for yourself if its your thing or not.",2
confusing. EXTREMELY ADDICTING. what a good game needs.great game. recomend it to any old school takers. good rpg .BUY IT,4
absolute rubbish. game loads then won't let you enter text. audio input doesn't work either. and that was just the opening screen asking if you want instructions. hello? this is a text-type game! shame the developer couldn't even get something like this rite. i prolly won't try any other games from them seeing how they completely crashed and burned on this which is literally pc gaming 101.,1
this game is todally lots of fun me and my aunt made a map yo go along with this game I still don't know how to get out of the maze but I love trying to.get this game u wont regret it.,5
"Didn't order this, but you can't go wrong with hanayama metal puzzles. They are all very well made, generally not too expensive, and if you get stuck, SOMEBODY on YouTube will have a video solution.",3
This is how it all began. My first computer class finals revolved around creating a game modeled after this one. Do yourself a favor and get this. It provides hours and hours of head scratching fun.,5
"This is for those who are old enough to remember playing Colossal Cave Adventure (ADVENT) way back in the old days.  These days, graphics in games are the norm.  If you want an experience that's different than all the third-person shooters, then try this out.  It's very basic with its vocabulary, but if you can manage to get into it, it's a very enjoyable and very vivid adventure because the graphics are all in your head.  It's one of the best relics of interactive fiction.  Infocom games started out soon after this and are very similar.  It's a lot like Zork I, but a little different.",5
unfortunately it isn't quiet as good as i remembered it to be.  Having said that it is still an interesting way to waste a few minutes here and there.,3
"I've never played a text based game, but thought I woul try this after reading some of the glowing reviews. I can see why people would have fallen in love with a game like this in the 70s, but I'm not sure it will ever be a favorite of mine.",4
"I played the FORTRAN version on an IBM mainframe, 351 points, this is fairly close to it.  This genuinely a game in which you use your head, and a hand drawn map.One thing that needs to be added is auto-save due to how freely Android tosses a program out.",4
"if you just want to feel guilty about what youre eating, this app is great. however, if you want to know the actual caloric content of what youre eating, this app is a waste. it lacks many selections and key features, and the data that it does have doesnt even jive with the internet",1
"I don't get all the grief given this app.  Sure, if you want to go thru a bunch of web sites to find this info, go for it.  I'd rather have this quick reference on my phone that I can just open up quickly and know how many calories a Big Mac has without navigating a web site on a phone browser for 5 minutes.  And, hey, it's free today!  5 stars!",5
"Very very very disappointing that this app does not count calories as it claims. Hopefully someday in the future it will be updated to include this KEY feature. But until then, the developer can count 2 stars.",2
"Only used the app a few times. What seemed pretty cool (which I got for free app day) wasn't too helpful at all. All the numbers are kind of in a really bland and un-aesthetically pleasing format. I don't really care for the app much at all, so I uninstalled it from my phone, but it's still there on the amazon appstore just in case I want to download it again.",2
"I hate to say it, but I really expected more from a (normally) paid app. The list of restaurants is disappointingly short and there doesn't seem to be a way to add up menu items for a grand total. The app is called calorie counter, but it doesn't count anything. It simply allows you to pick a restaurant, look at a list of menu items, and touch each item to see its nutritional values. No pictures, no way to add up the various items to total up the meal, no way to keep track of your history to try to reduce calorie intake and raise protein intake... nothing particularly useful.This was most disappointing when looking at the list of ingredients at chipotle. It lists out the tortillas, chips, salsa, meat, cheese, beans... etc. But no way to build the burrito or plate to know what you're about to eat. I am not a developer, but there is no way this feature would be difficult to add.Lastly, I should be able to enter my calorie intake goals and be able to see where most of my calories come from. Without this feature, it is just an app full of raw data. I am almost certain that I can find all of this information on a single website if I googled it. I really got my hopes up on this app and I can't believe anyone would pay $3 for this raw and freely available information.This app has potential to be extremely useful. Most of my meals come from local restaurants. Add these features and I might just pull out my phone for something other than words with friends during my meal.",2
"If this app were free, I'd probably give it 3, maybe 4 stars if it supported Android 3.0.  For $3?  It's lucky to get even 1.They seem to have left out a number of places, like IHOP (they have Denny's, though), Taco Johns, Papa Murphy's and Golden Corral (though they have Old Country Buffet).It also just displays nutritional info, but it lacks the ability to put together a whole meal and get a total of all those numbers.There are free apps that do a much better job of calorie counting than this one.",1
"Easy interface, author has gone to a lot of work with input. Of course, one restaurant I wanted to see, SmashBurger, is not listed. But 75 restaurants are a good start. I hope there will be updates, I love the idea.",4
"Here's a better idea, don't ready fast food. A fast good calorie counter is as useful as a rubber crutch.",1
"I'm assuming this application is a work in progress, as there are currently an odd mix of restaurants. The major places are covered of course, along with some various other places I'm not familiar with. If the dev continues to add to this list, it could prove to be a very extensive resource!The ability to sort by macronutrient or name is very cool. Good idea.The inclusion of some of the chain restaurants that aren't fast food would be very nice. I see applebees is there so it looks to be in the works.A utility in the program to request restaurants to add or even reference sources such as a url or something to make it easier for the dev to find and add more places would be icing on the cake.Cool application. I hope to see it grow.  For the health conscious out there, it's a no brainer on this free day!  (Thanks Amazon!)",5
"The UI is a bit plain but it serves its purpose. Not a bad app overall, plus its free.... ....",3
"just downloaded and browsed through some of my favorite foods at certain restaurants.. shocked to see how much fat some of them have, this app will really sway my decision making while eating out..",5
quick and easy to use. It will assist me in choosing healther choices while on the go. this is my new favorite app,5
"The developers think this is worth $2.99?  Really? There's no saturated fat listing, items can't be combined to make a meal, and the Chipotle section doles out the info piece by piece. So you have to check the salsa, then the steak, then the cheese... and add it all up in your head.  Uninstall.",1
"It does give you calories (and four other facts) for the items you'll find on the menu but it only gives you four and you can't put it all together.  For instance, if you look at Chipotle on the app, you can see the beans and the rice and everything's nutritional facts but unless you're writing it all down and adding it all up, you have no general idea of the nutritional facts of the burrito you're about to eat.  And by ""nutritional facts"" I mean fat, protein, calories, fiber, and carbs since that's all they give you.  Glad I didn't pay for it.",2
Good app.  Missing some menu items that will hopefully come in an update.  Makes you think twice about things that you regularly order.,4
"This dev can do much better - check the features for the iPhone version. I concur with the critical reviews this has been getting.  This has a decent # of restaurants and the ability to sort by various fields (calories, etc.), but definitely needs way more. It doesn't actually count anything; you can't change menu items to subtract items like mayo(which many websites do); there's no real size selection; it is missing key details like saturated fat, sodium, & sugar; other reviews have noted inaccuracies & that it is out of date on some items; needs app 2 sd card; it should also have a ""favorites"" option for restaurants & menu items for quick look-up. Clearly an app like this is much-needed, but this doesn't fill the void. Other reviewers suggested My Fitness Pal, Calorie Counter & MyNetDiary apps; I'm going to check them out.",3
"The only thing this application is good for is a quick nutritional reference to a limited number of fast food options.  It does nothing to count your calories for you. Now I could see it being handy when you're in a fast food joint and need to check the calories in your meal, because it is quicker than searching online.  This application is worth nothing more than 99 cents and would be better being free and ad supported.",2
"The app does what it says and it has a decent number of popular fast food chains. However, it is certainly not worth $2.99 for a few reasons.Pros: Easy to pick icon driven restaurant chooser. No ads.Cons: Only has 71 restaurants. Once you select the restaurant you get a basic menu driven list like most other apps. Only displays calories, fat, carbs, fiber and protein. So there is no report of saturated fat, vitamins, or other useful info. It only displays one item at a time, so adding up a meal would be a very arduous process that would require pen, paper, and probably a calculator. I could actually go on and on.Summary: Basically, there are a lot of other apps that do a better job, provide more information, are more useful, easier to use, and all around higher quality.",3
out of the available chains i only have one! where is Mcdonalds??? KFC? Wendy's? Taco Bell? Baja Fresh? free apps are really sucking,1
"First you're restricted to the restaurants it has listed (no Red Robin for example). If you do choose from the list you don't get to choose sizes. If you happen to get the only size, it still doesn't count for you, it's just a lookup.Ultimately that's what this app is, a simple online menu lookup for some restaurants with only one size and no descriptions.There is a search feature, but really it's just a filter, you can't search across menus for instance.The first free app of the day where I'm sad that even though it was free to me Amazon is paying the dev 1/5th list price. Sorry Amazon.",1
"I was hoping for more to come of this app as the idea of an app that can help you add up the caloric intake is a great idea, but this app could use some extra work.  I'm glad I picked this up for free and didn't pay the $2 for it.  I'll still keep it, and probably refer to it, but the interface is not all that great to work around and I really wish it would allow you to look at several food items at once so you can see everything.I do appreciate that it is more than calories, knowing how much fat, protein, carbs, and fiber is also useful.I hope they update this app, I would like to see it become more than it is.",2
"Pros:+ Good purpose.Cons:- Does not have many food options.- Does not have an easy-to-use interface.- Looks ugly.- Does not seem to count calories accurately.I got this app as a freebie, so no harm, no foul.",1
Total calories is only part of the equation. We need to have a breakdown such that we can see how many calories is that 21g of fat.It would be nice to be able to see generic items such as &quot;corndog&quot; - sometimes we get stuff from vendors that aren't a national chain.,2
and shocked at the calories in something you love to eat .  I an not heavy but still watch what I eat.  some of these are really high in calories.This is a must have application for everyone.,5
"I know this app is called a fast food calorie counter which is sort of misleading since it does not count calories for you, but I think it is still awesome.My wife and I have carried around a little book called the Calorie King which does the same thing but cost $10. While this app does not include certain resteraunts such as Red Robin (as some have complained about) we must keep in mind that this is a Fast Food calorie counter. The fact that places like Bob Evans and Chipotle are even on this list are a bonus.As for the fast food selection, it is darn good. I dont have one fast food place in my area that is not listed. They even go into detail by showing calories for individual condoments!I would have rated this 4 because I too would have liked to see an adding capability within this app but since so many people felt it necessary to give 1's just for missing that small part, I want to give it a 5 to boost up its overall rating because this is not a bad app. Like I said it is competing with calorie look up books that do the same thing for 3 times the price. Normally a great deal but today its a steal!",5
"I read the reviews for this one &amp; figured it would suck, but knowing how unreliable the reviews on here can be, I decided to check it out for myself just to be sure.  Well, they're right on about this one.There's one single good thing about this app, &amp; that's the fact that you can sort a restaurant's menu by calories or fat, or any of the other 5 or so ways they have listed. The only time I eat at any of these places is if I'm with someone else who really wants to eat there. So, if you're like me, this might be useful if you're looking to find the least fattening thing on the menu to eat. Regardless, it won't add up menu items for you, so you're going to be adding it up on your own if you want to know how much your whole meal is worth. This would be especially tedious if you were getting a salad, for example, as the dressing, croutons, etc. are listed separately &amp; would have to be added up separately.  Add the fact that they don't usually have all sizes listed, &amp; this app just becomes basically useless.It's a pain sifting though their lists no matter how you sort them. Not all restaurants are listed. When you find your restaurant, not all items or sizes are included. You can't add up menu items. The list could go on &amp; on. Plain &amp; simple this app sucks. They should be ashamed to charge people for this thing, &amp; I'm almost positive you could find a free one that's much more complete &amp; user friendly. For free it's an incomplete list I still won't waste my phone memory on. If it's a work in progress, then give it for free or don't release it until it's done.Restaurants have dietary info available that you can ask to see, or you can get online &amp; see it. Either way, you'll get a better list than this app gives you. Or, do yourself a favor &amp; don't eat fast food. Once you get used to eating healthy, you don't need a list or a calorie counter to help.",2
"Even for $0, this app is not worth it. Doesn't do anything you would expect of a &quot;calorie counting&quot; app. You would hope it would let you add up items or something, but no. I guess you could look things up and write them down and then add up the calories later, but that defeats the purpose of such an app.",1
really wamt.to.like this app.  it is loaded with info soni guess i should.gibe ot 4-5 stars... except I cant... No sd card support.  an app has to be fantastic to warrant no sd card support if its going to compete with other apps that do.  3 stars until it aupports.sd mempry,3
Wow........people are very hard to please even when something is FREE! It does what it says it does! (Did they think they'd be chatting with a Nutritionist from the Mayo Clinic???),4
"I expected a lot more. Not sure if thats because other calorie counting apps have set the bar so high, or because this one is just that bad. The list of restaurants is extremely short. The app doesn't look like anything special, considering the dev's want money for it. It lacks so many features, features that every other app of this category have. There should be some sense of customizing meals. Even if they didn't go above and beyond, selecting 1 standard size for each item is ridiculous. Some of these fast food sites even let you build your meal and see the totals. Honestly, this is a poor excuse for a calorie counting app. Don't waste your time.Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)",1
"Everyone else is right - this app is pretty bad. Almost every single one of these restaurants already has this information on their web sites, and most of those allow you to build a meal so that you can actually COUNT calories.This app is also sorely lacking in food and restaurants. The Arby's Angus Three Cheese and Bacon is missing, and I've been seeing commercials for that for several weeks now. Plus the restaurant Zaxby's isn't listed at all.Honestly this would be tolerable were this a free app, it really wouldn't be worth. 99, but frankly for the dev to charge 3 bucks for this is just downright insulting.",1
Needs robecks. add more restaurants. better sorting. forget fast food. I am pist that amazon is making me write 20 words,2
"I like this app, I used it alot when traveling on vacation to watch my calorie intake. Very good app",5
"I used this for a while and it seemed to work good.  Now I also have the Fast food nutrition lite as well and it seems to be better and worse in some ways.  For Free, use which ever cost's less.",4
"Thank god I got it free, because its not worth paying for it. It gives you a basic idea of what your calorie intake could be.",3
"I am very thankful that amazon gives a paid app a day for free, but that doesn't change the fact that this app is bad in a bad way. Most places have calorie counters now, and if you can retain info and learn simple calculations, you will never need this. Especially at 3 bucks after today...",1
There  is no way I would have paid for this app. It's missing tons of places. Doesn't do any more than free apps of the same kind would. No wonder it's free.,1
"A good database, but could use some more features, like favorite restaurants, adding ones not in the list, sorting by location, nearest me, etc.Maybe let me construct a meal and tally it up, favorite meals, etc.Also needs a better main menu.Needs more work, probably not worth $3.",3
If you paid for this app. I hope you got a refund before you ran down to get your burrito supreme. Uninstall. Htc evo,1
O M  G this is the best spell check invented ever!!!  Thanks for making it who ever you are &#60;3!!,5
It didn't work for me.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong but it should be user friendly.  I'm going to delete it.,1
"This app is very good to have aboard!!!  It does exactly what it is advertised to do, and I can't find a down sign.",4
Now this is good. Voice recognition is great. This is a precise app. I use it when not using word.,5
This is wonderful. Where would I be without it? I'm glad I found this app. Use it all the time.,5
It does the basic job of checking spelling of student's writing. It is easy to use. It is a good value.,4
"I was in the middle of writing something...rotated my screen from landscape to portrait and lost everything I wrote. The text area cleared. Obviously, the screen should be able to be rotated without losing the text. The only reason this app gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because this is the only fault I have found...it spell checks well and all that but...the frustration from being unable to rotate it gives this 2 stars.",2
Had to delete because it would not load properly!  Guess I will have to hunt for another app to spell check.,1
It is had to rate Spell Checker App because it did not download to my Kindle Fire. So I do not have it to rate the app.,1
"This is the Best Spellchecker that I have found for my droid. But, why can't it be integrated into what you are typing in originally? The cut and paste thing is really getting old! Google has to give a little on this one!",4
"I am the worse speller, too bad I don't have on this conputter, I got it on my kindal and bails me out when I write e-mails, comments on facebook, it is so wonderful",5
I have not needed to use this product too much yet. But I am very grateful to have it for when I do.,3
It does not help you spell at all. I see no purpose for this ap. Nothing more to say. im done.,1
This seamed like a good app . But i had to delete it because my kindle does not come with voice recognition.,2
this game is great. if you are a fan of yahtzee then you will love this. its quick and the controls are well done. the only thing I would suggest is a multiplayer mode. well worth the download,5
This app is an excellent time passer.  I did change the color of the background.  I am not to thrilled with how the dice move but not enough to uninstall it.,4
"I like this version of Yahtzee, easy to use and play. Very addictive trying to set high score (523) Fun",4
This was a really terrible yahtzee game.  How can you ruin Yahtzee?  But they succeeded in doing so.  Don't bother.,1
"not bad as a game at all!  Nice, basic and exactly what I was looking for.  It's a little unclear at the end of the game to tell exactly how you did on the high scores page, but I noticed that the score line highlighted is your correct score.",4
This is a fun game to play on my kindle that is essentially yatzee. I've not had any technical problems either.,5
the best game ever and I play it about three or four times a day. it is easy to use,5
"permissions needed for a simple dice game?  I don't like how the advertising is located conveniently too close to the &quot;roll&quot; bar, the dice (as you try to highlight them), and the options tab at the bottom of the screen.  I have accidentally hit the ad countless times and had to back out numerous. times in the middle of a game.  (KFire)  I also dislike that extra 5 of a kind cannot be counted as a score for a full house.iI give it 2 stars because the actual gameplay is pretty quick.Going to uninstall to see if I can't find one I like better,  or at least one that doesn't have gameplay functions literally on top of ad links.  I got a FAR better Yahtzi game on a CD out of a cereal box!",2
"I was looking for a yahtzee like game , and this one fits the bill..very simple and nice layout. Love it!",5
"I used to play Yahtzee when I was younger and this game is just like it.  Works great on the Kindle Fire, I've had no problems with the app.  I wish it had multi player capability but my wife plays it on her Fire and I play on mine and we compare scores.  I like the features of being able to move an item places in case you tap the wrong field.  The color change in the options is nice but it will sometime revert back to the original color then change to the color scheme you selected.Overall it's a fun app if you like playing Yahtzee.",5
It is very easy to understand and use.  I like it much better than other versions of the &#34;yahtzee&#34; game.,5
this is a very. cool app for kindle fire and its kind of like the game of yahatzz so get this game,5
I like a game with more interaction.  As for being a free game it was just okay.  It was a boring game.,2
"It works well and is very simple to use.  It's Yachtzee/Yacht or similar.  What else can one say about it, Amazon?",4
"This is YAHTZEE, no matter what you call it. Love the simple graphics and the smooth play. It even has an &#34;undo&#34; in case you make a rash decision. Nothing bad here, just loads of fun!",5
"This is fun game to pass the time. It's not very visually appealing, but it will do. I've enjoyed it so far.",3
"Game was great until last update included the ads at the bottom.  The ads don't bother me, but the screen response now has a delay that didn't exist before.  Makes it very difficult to highlight the dice you want to keep from a roll.",3
"Not a bad version of Yahtzee.  It's very basic without a lot of &#34;glitz and glamor&#34; of other kindle games - but it is an easy way of playing Yahtzee.  I do miss the option though of using a second 5 of a kind as a wild (like you can in the Yahtzee game).  Otherwise, it's the basic Yahtzee.",4
Another fun game and I have played it many times while waiting to pickup the grandkids at their school.,5
"this is a great app. it does not freeze up on kindle fire or put banner ads where you accidentally click on them while playing. only 1 glitches and that is there is not an extra place for multiple 5 of a kind rolls like the reg. game,instead you have to place the additional rolls wherever they fit best for bonus. otherwise, perfection and hours of fun.",4
This is a great game on the fire. I read the other reviews and thought I would give it a try and I am not disappointed at all. Great way to pass the time.,5
Fun mindless game.  Since I play myself there's no winning or losing unless I try to beat my previous high score (which I generally ignore).,4
I love yahtzee. Its not the digital one I'm used to but its ok. Kind of too predictable though unfortunately,3
It is a fun game but it needs to have a &#34;back&#34; button. If you mistakenly drop the dice on the wrong entry you are stuck. And sometimes when you hold say three dice and then draw another two the dice don't appear to change but you loose your turn. Too many quirks!,3
"I got this game because I  like the game yachtzee, but it is missing the excitement of actually rolling the dice. I also miss having an opponent. The sound effects are ok. What I do like is the quickness of each game. It is helpful too when it gives you hints about where to put your score. Makes for less thinking. I can whip out game after game, but it takes away from enjoyment. It's a good game to play if you are just trying to pass a few minutes of time. Glad it was free.",3
I love Yatzee but didnt want to have to keep paying to play the game.This is all the fun without the expense.,5
This game is simplicity at its best. It's easy to play and easy to change background colors and dice colors.,4
I LIKE THIS GAME BUT I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO TAP THE SCREEN UNINTENTIONALLY AS SOMETIMES I ROLL THE DICE BEFORE I'M READY. THIS HAPPENS ESPECIALLY WHEN RIDING IN THE CAR AND WE GO OVER A ROUGH SPOT.,4
Simple layout and controls make this game enjoyable.  The game is fast and stable.Prepare to get addicted to fun.,5
very low tech game but it is like yahtzee so I would recommend it at least until there is a better one available on kindle,3
very fun game enjoyed it a lot/ For some reason took me a while for my eyes to adjust to the screen.,5
Very fun game and addicting. Very much like Yahtzee. Easy game for kids to play and passes the time while waiting.,5
"It's simple, It's dice... It's one of the best apps I've downloaded. It works fast and accurately on my lower end tablet and the interface is simple, but attractive. I love the musical tones when you ""hold"" a die and I love the sound when you ""roll"" the dice. The ability to change the colors of the game just adds to its appeal for me. I'm rocking my own little pink game of yahtzee AS I TYPE THIS. Then I'm going to head over and buy the paid version.",5
Another throw back game.It is a quick play game not somethingthat I can sit and play for hours on end.it is worth the download.,3
A wonderful game and just as fun as Yahtzee which I could play for hours. The quality is excellent and if you like Yahtzee you'll love this game too. Don't hesitate with this one.,5
I play it alitle. That's all I have to say. That's all I have to say. That's all I have to say.,4
"This is a single-person game, just great for filling in odd moments while in line, waiting in the doctor's office, or other times when a few games could fit into a busy schedule.",5
"Fun to play, if you have time to waste...most of us do, but retirees especially. It is well written, covers the same things that Yahtzee covers...not sure that five letters work quite the same, but it's fun and entertaining...especially in the middle of the night when there is NO TV to watch!!",5
I like the visuals.  The app provides a lot of good data for those that like such things.  Worth the download.,4
I'm an avid fan of satellite/space view apps and this one is high on my list. Proof that practicality and beauty can be hand in hand. Gorgeous to look at. Informative to use. I wish more apps were this good. Keep up the good work!,5
I like this app because of the globe mode that shows a realistic view of the earth for the specific time and location on the planet you are in. Really really nice.,5
"Just the realtime 3D illuminated, snow-covered satellite enhanced globe widget alone would make this worth the price.  Stunning, gorgeous, useful...can't praise this app enough for what it does.  My wife is on the other side of the world, and with this app, I can immediately see if it's night or day over there.",5
"I bought mine for Kindle Fire and I love it.It has many different unique features that I use.I love the moon feature, very cool.Recommended.",5
"I love this app!  It's very cool to watch sunrise, sunset, and and everything in between.I would recommend this app to those who are really into space and time as well as thosewho just think it looks really neat!  :-)",5
This is a cool little app even though my clock doesn't keep time for reason. Not an important part of the app in my estimation. My kids really like seeing where the sun and the moon are in relation to our position on the planet. One improvement would be the ability to zoom in even more.,5
"This is about one of the coolest app I have seen in a long time. It is easy to use, and het around on. It took me a couple minutes to figure it out. But I give an easy 5 stars.",5
This is a really good app. It will show you where day and night is at in real time. No matter where you are. This is one of the few apps I keep using.,4
I love it . I wish I could change time zones. Seeing the darkness and daylight in real time on the globe.,5
Nothing like a birds eye on the World!  This is a very interesting app and the globe can be your guide.  You can manually adjust the globe to see anyplace on the planet that you want and it also revolves in real time too!  Great learning tool for those interested in the world and planet!,5
"Really, really, &#34;busy&#34; and quickly can cause a headache! For me it was a distraction. To many things and information happening all at once.",2
"I think this is an awesome app.  I use it as my live wallpaper on my ICS Toshiba Thrive tablet.  Seeing the lighted and darkened portions of the globe move across the screen, watching weather develop and move across the oceans and the land and more are an ever-changing  treat.  I really am glad that I've gotten this.",5
"Just downloaded and installed. I was amazed at how fast this app installed, I expected it to take longer because of the incredibly detailed images. All views are gorgeous on the Kindle Fire. Took me a couple of seconds to figure out how to get back to the view I wanted, but now that I have it figured out, I'm having no problems navigating around the app. Well worth the price. The only thing that doesn't seem to work on the Kindle Fire is the ""keep Earth stable as device is rotated."" Although it could be that I don't understand that feature.",5
"I'm still experimenting with this app, but I like it. It gives you a world perspective in your hands, sort of a solar birds eye view of everywhere at once. If a panoramic outer space image appeals you will like this.",4
"Really cool app!  This app has a ton of info and some cool graphics.  You get sunrise, sunset, moon rise and set.  Temp and weather data too. I like the world map that shows day and night.  It runs fine on my Kindle Fire.",5
"I have to admit, I've heard this app does teach children how to deal with how to park cars w/o crashing and with rush hour traffic as well.",4
This app is a perfect port of the simulator that we use in valet training.  Highly recommended for aspiring valets who need extra practice to pass the final exam at the 6 week training camp.,5
"I have a real game called ""Rush Hour.""  This is very similar to that game.  This is a logic game where you are trying to move the red car to the exit.  Sounds easy, right?  It is not, but that is the fun part.  You must try to move the other cars so the red car can move.  It is fun and challenging.  My sons (7 y.o.) love this game and I think it is great for them to play a fun, thinking game.  I would recommend this game to anyone looking for thinking game.I have seen other reviews about privacy issues and I do not know about that.",5
The puzzles are great and the car theme is fun... Much more interesting then simple blocks would have been.  Lots of content here and will take a long time to play it all.,5
this is a fun game and even better app! works great on the fire! my children love it as do I!,5
"This is a puzzle game where you move cars around to get your little red race car out. I like the idea, but it's a little hard to see; I don't know if it's got too many colors and things going on or the puzzle area is too small. Also doesn't have hints.. ugh Or at least not that I've found.",3
"I don't quite understand the reasoning behind some of the one star ratings.1 star because the app doesn't work on your phone, even though the dev tells you openly it won't work? grow up.back onto the review - as people have said it is like unlock me, but sometimes a change of scenery in a game is nice. who knows, maybe the dev will add more onto it later and support those other phones.",5
thus is the greatest game ever no socks great graphics are u happy dude I rated you 5 stars no seriously u happy dude huh dude happy ? dude? happy? du?,5
great. as if superman75 wasn't enough now we have a umadbro and spiderman75 leaving crappy useless 1star reviews. have you guys ever built anything in your lives? if you have to leave crappy useless reviews at least give the app a correct rating! these guys should be banned.,5
I would never pay for an app like this but as far as free app of the day goes this is a pretty kewl game. Works great on kindle fire.,5
This app is grete with the puzzles and all but it isn't my fab app. It has great puzzles that are just the right challenge but I got bored,3
While the concept certainly isn't new this game is definitely worth trying out if you like puzzle games. The graphics are well drawn and colorful and while there isn't much to the sound effects what is there sounds good. There are a ton of levels and plenty of challenge here.Overall this is a very solid game and an excellent free app of the day. If you missed it for free I do think it is definitely worth the normal 99 cent asking price.,4
"a simple slider puzzle, but solo addictive.  works great on the kindle.  this is my favorite kindle game so far.",5
I prefer brain teasers to video games. This is a good way to use abstract & critical thinking. My 10yo loves to play w me too.,5
"works great, easy to understand, have played unblockme and have to say, like this WAY better! I don't understand all the 1star reviews...",5
"The most addicitive game next to angry birds, very good game will keep you entertained for hours, I find my self playing this on the train and missing my stop because I am trying to beat a leverl.",5
first I would like to thank all my friends at amazon for the well wishes on a speedy recovery. I couldn't do it without you. today I left the hospital and on my way home I downloaded the faotd because it looked interesting. well im glad I did. when I got to the garage at me apartment I realized that about 1000 people must have moved im and all their cars were everywhere. so I grabbed my phone and started practicing after about level 14 I realized what I needed to do to get my car in a spot. thanks amazon I just wish everybody in my apartment building had this to so we could keep the garage organized.,4
PARENTS BEWARE THIS GAME IS STUPID DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS STUPID APP ALL YOU  DO IS PARK AND PARK AND IT WILL GET BORING AND YOU WILL OFFICIALLY  HATE IT DO NOT GET THIS APP!!,1
color good. graphics move smoothly but it does not work on my Samsung Instinct 2.2 android OS.  i have a small screen.  maybe this game is made for bigger newer phones 2.3 android maybe,1
"Something a little bit different. The difficulty is gradual, just enough to be challenging. I love the graphics and sound on my Toshiba Thrive. Thanks for a fun game!",5
This game is pretty challenging and is well worth the 99&cent;. This is a fun time killer and my older children find it entertaining!,4
"Just to offset the morons like Matthew who obviously can't read. The setting is a parking lot! Once again, give your parents phone back and go to bed!",5
downloaded the app because it was free.  Tried it out and it was a fine app.  I just haven't used it for any length of time because it didn't interest me.,3
"this app can easily slide to the &quot;best FAOTD's&quot; list because of its rich graphics challenging and huge amounts of car-driving fun the cars are neat, and I can gladly say that my experience has been bug-less with the Kindle Firecons : I don't like the sound effects.but that is not a deal breaker and those are only trivial matters so feel free ti purchase this app wether its free or paid.",5
I would of given this more stars but couldn't get farther/deeper into the game.LOL Guess you really have to be smarter than what game you are playing...I amobviously parking challenged.  I would think this would keep a young teen busyfor hours!  Colorful graphics.,3
"yes similar but a well done remake.  this is a great game, will provide hours of entertainment and the game play is excellent.",5
"This is a great alternative for people who like the Unblock me app. I have this on my Kindle Fire, and the other U.b.M. app on my phone. Both apps are good games, but this just seems to work better on the fire. Great way to pass some extra time.",5
I love this game! Im mad I had to reset my kindle and cant remember where I had left off but its really fun great time killer when waiting for appointments and dont feel like reading or thinking.,5
"I played a few levels and it is amusing, it gets more challenging as you go. looks and plays well on the kindle. would not have bought this but glad to be trying it out for free and would consider buying similar games in the future.",5
I love this app! This is my kind of game! I enjoy games that make me think and make me feel like I'm enriching my mind. This app is fun while keeping my mind sharp.,5
"I know the description says ""not compatible with Droid"", but one reviewer said it ran fine on his Droid Bionic, so I figured I'd try.  Big mistake - the app ran really slow, then even slower, then hung the phone completely. The only recourse at that point was too pull the battery and restart.  Some may think one star is unfair, given that the app is merely (not) performing as advertised, but there's really no excuse for this kind of behavior on one of the most popular Android platforms.",1
"Nice enough game,  but Lookout ad network detector reported this title for just about every ad network.  :-(  Paid games should NOT be consuming your data plan for ads.  Period. Uninstalled.  Amaze 4G.",2
"This game reminds me of the tiles game, only with cars. Colorful and cute,with lots of levels and difficulty settings.Can't go wrong for the price.",5
"While this is an interesting variation on a sliding puzzle, it is not something I find all that enjoyable.  It does have nice graphics though, and seems to be well designed.",3
"These permissions are absolutely above and beyond what is required.  There is no reason why a simple game application needs to read the state of my phone, and CERTAINLY not the id of my calls.  Stay far away!",1
"like the old fashioned cube games, this requires some strategy and patience to solve the puzzle.  really fun game to play.",5
"great game, challenging and fun, though I am a bit worried about what other people here have listed about permissions.  but the game itself is fun.",4
"the droid is not an old system, nor is it the newest! how can a developer miss the boat on this one?! this is sloppiness and/or laziness on behalf of concrete software. games like this can work on the droid... unblock me is a perfect example! and before everyone starts a lynch mob, stating I am affiliated with them, I am not. I am just a user who appreciates a good puzzle game... unless the developers are too lazy to make their app compatible with popular devices! shame on you concrete! 0 stars if I could! come back when you learn to work out apps for all droid devices, especially the most popular ones!!!",1
"This app has a problem. The permissions in the Amazon store version include read and write access, opening network slots, and accessing information about networks. The same app in the Google Market version also asks for information about phone calls, and accesses your phone ID. This is the *same* app with less permissions - why? Obviously the developer was worried that the app wouldn't pass Amazon's reviewers, since it looks like the developer really wants your phone info (why? To sell, would be my guess). So you download this app and soon after you are alerted that there is an update. Of course, the update might be a great way to revert the app to the original permissions that were specified in the Market version.Guess what happens when you update the app.",1
these game is hard but fun.its the best game I have on my kindle fire.I like these game becouse its fun,5
"Permissions are way too much to ask for to play a traffic puzzle game. Growing very tired of excessive invasion of privacy esp. for stuff like puzzles and games. Bad enough you have to give permission to important apps and utilities. No longer will I download any apps asking for the same types of permissions using excuses like feint and leader boards, bug reports, e-mail, all of it. Just a poor excuse to have access to data of value to sell & make up for lack of people buying the apps. Every single dev says they dont use the data they can access or make it available to data miner companies. So who is responsible for all the massive data stealing through apps? Nobody, so it must be the Spyware Fairy.",1
I love this game it rocks my friend and I play it at Haley house it is truely great really really great.,5
This game is really fun. But this is my opoinion. I'm not really that crazy about puzzles. People who love puzzles will love this game.,4
Unblock me is better. This game is weak. Much better versions out there. Graphics are cool though. I only give it 2.5 stars.,2
it is so freaking addicting its so hard to put my kindle down now. it is just so freaking amazing,5
when you are doing the puzzle to the right there is so much there that when all you want is a simple restart and you have to look around for a bit.finding restart is harder than the puzzles,2
Very fun puzzle game. The game is kinda like unblock me puzzle game. Works great on kindle fire. Got it for free cause it's the Apo of the day.,5
"To those concerned about downloading apps and becoming victims of data mining businesses, I've listed what this developer was asking for on Market vs. the ""dog and pony show version"" you're now downloading on Amazon (THAT WILL SURELY BE UPDATED sometime after FAOTD when the developer feels you've already trusted his app, are not paying close attention, and are ""simply updating"" for some other minor bug fix).Permisssions the developer submitted in his AMAZON FAOTD version:(the version you are considering downloading... for NOW)* Read only access to phone state.* Write to external storage.* Open network sockets.* Access information about Wi-Fi networks.* Access the vibration feature.* Access information about networks.The STANDARD permissions the developer currently asks for in his MARKET version:(NOTE: for both PAID & FREE Market versions identical, and only FREE version has ""ads"")* Network communication - full Internet access - Allows an application to create network sockets.* Phone calls - read phone state and identity - Allows the application to access the phone features of thedevice. An application with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of thisphone, whether a call is active, the number that call is conncted to and the like.* Storage - modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents - Allows an application towrite to the USB storage. Allows an application to write to the SD card.* Hardware controls - control vibrator - Allows the application to control the vibrator.* Network communication - view network state - Allows an application to view the state of all networks.* view Wi-Fi state - Allows an application to view the information about the state of Wi-Fi. (network comm.)Anyone who looks at the Market versions can clearly see those permissions are way out of wack to run a ""car version"" of the Block Me game, especially the Market's PAID version.  The developer wants ALL those permissions in BOTH free and paid versions, so in the paid version, you're paying for ""more game"" and not ""less/no ads.""  The developer clearly doesn't care about giving you more ""game"" for the money, because he has no intention of changing the unbelievably invasive permissions that are the poster child for data mining.Now the developer faces Amazon.  He knows asking for your phone's ID and serial number and a list of all the numbers of who you call, and who called you, are going to pop right out to Amazon reviewers as the BIG CLUE that he is data mining.  So he takes it out.... but he leaves in the others and hopes those permissions gets defended as necessary for that wonderful ""leaderboard action"" and ""rate this app"" and ""notify me of bugs"" stuff, as so many unknowing Amazon reviewers DO have a habit of doing to justify keeping the free app they don't want to part with.READ THE PERMISSIONS YOURSELF and YOU decide how the developer makes a living off this app, what he did to get onto Amazon FAOTD, what all those permissions on the Amazon version add up to (even WITHOUT the phone serial number request), why phone information is wanted by the developer on all other versions but this Amazon one (for now), and what he'll likely do to update YOUR app once he's out of the Amazon spotlight.If you doubt the developer will add the phone stuff back, just go right here on Amazon and look at any of the other 16 apps this developer put out here, for instance the ""paid"" version of Bubble Popper.  The permission for the phone is IN there, even in that PAID version.P.S.  Misspellings in an app itself realllllllly get me nervous as to who is developing these apps and why, especially considering the massive phone ID serial numbers theft originating from Asia. Why they can't get or don't want an English-speaking American to look it over first before marketing to America makes me cock my eyebrow in a BIG way.",1
Very fun game that's challenging to play.I believe that the games uses network communication to keep track of game leaders and lowest number of moves for each puzzle.,5
"played fine on my amaze, smooth and decent graphics BUT I don't much care for the game its not something I would play. 5 stars for performance on my phone though lol",5
"I've played this game before on the Android and the iPad. It is a fun, spacial puzzle game that has always challenged and entertained me. I hesitant to pick this up but then decided to give it a shot. I **LOVE** the graphics. I've never seen one look this good. The cars take on a more 3D tone than the other games I've tried.If you like this type of puzzle game, or are looking for a puzzle game to play, then you might want to try this one out.",5
"This is similar to, but even better than the plastic Rush Hour puzzle from ThinkFun, and that was one of my favorites (pre-kindle).  It has great effects, challenging levels, and a count of moves so you can try to beat your best solution for each puzzle.  I couldn't think of anything that would make it any better.  Well worth whatever price.",5
Wait... this game doesn't require memory.. what the heck is Janos talking about??? Well I played a version of this game as a kid... I spent hours getting good at it... it is a wonderful game of mental gymnastics as you move the cars around... it is a wonderful game filled with good memories of playing as a kid... it is still a great challenge ...  my goal is always to do the puzzle in less than a minute... easy for the first 10 puzzles....,5
"I have the parking lot game,different development team, that would play on my phone and tablet. Unforantly the graphics were poor on the ten inch screen. The author of this game did a great job on improving the graphics in this version.  Ironically my phone is a Droid Razr so per the developer's comments, I can only play this on my tablet and play the other version on my phone. Overall it is great game regardless of the eye candy and I highly recommend it for all ages. (Toshiba Thrive 3.2.1)",4
I decided to try this game and it is really fun. I'm glad it was FAOTD. It plays smooth and looks quick. Some of the sound effects are annoying but that's my only gripe.,4
"This is a very fun way to waist (spend) time. As far as all the worry about datamining? If your playing on a Kindle Fire, as I am what data can they get? Also if your worried just disable Internet access before starting the game.  Believe me, it is well worth any small effort just to play this game.  To all you yelling about this being a copy of other games like Blockme,,, almost every game is a copy of the one that came before it.  It's called innovation or improvement.  Paranoia is sometimes a good thing but this is just a game and an easy workaround for any phone users.  I would readily put this as one of the most brain teasing and fun games on Amazon.  jmho",5
"This game is exactly like UnblockMe (which has well over 1000 levels and is free) and RushHour (which already incorporated cars, only with better animations and was available as faotd a while back)...",2
This game is fun for all ages and people that enjoy a good puzzle. Would like to see more like it.,4
"This is a great game.  It is a real mind twister and a lot of fun to play.  Each level is not easy and there are 480 puzzles to play and each one gets harder.  I played for over an hour and I really thought this game concept was unique and fun to play. It reminds me of being trapped in Manhattan in grid lock and trying to get to the airport to catch a flight.Based on game play it is a 5 star rating, based on violating my privacy is should be a Zero star rating!Now the bad part, why does a simple game app need access to my Kindle Fire data?  Here are the permissions that it asks for access to:* Storage (OK)* Network Communication (not OK)* Kindle calls for Kindle state and Identity (not OK)* View network state (not OK)* View WIFI state (not OK)* Hardware controls to control vibrator (OK)There is no good reason why any app needs my Kindle state and ID.  This is another app that either collects the data for themselves or for the tooling software company who developed the app development software.Such programs are under investigation now by 35 State Attorneys General who are asking the five major app selling distributors (Including Amazon) to require the app developers to disclose their privacy policies before their services are installed on a device.  At question is the ability to pull sensitive information from your device and use it themselves or resell it to other companies.Most app developers have not even drawn up privacy policies as they believe that they are outside of a 7 year old law governing online privacy.  Such apps can drill into your address books and other personal files on smart phones and tablets.  The states feel that most people rightfully do not want that to happen and don't even know that it is going on inside of their device.The Federal Trade Commission has released a study that indicates that the app makers are collecting data even about children and violating federal laws.The answer is not a 10 page publication regarding the app makers privacy policy, the answer is simply, ""DO NOT COLLECT MY PRIVATE DATA FOR ANY REASON!""  Writing a privacy policy may make some app makers think twice about misusing data but how will that protect the consumer when the app developer is overseas and out of reach of the federal and state laws and jurisdictions?For the above mentioned reasons I give this app 1 star as that is the lowest I can go.  Please stop putting data collection software onto my personal and private devices!",1
"Fun game to play really gets you thinking , excersize for the brain , needs a hint button on some harder puzzles , nice graphics and layout easy to use .",4
I really enjoy the brain teasers here. but I am stuck on one and think having some hints thrown in would be a great addition.,4
"It's a great puzzle game, the first one was pretty easy, the farther you get into the game the harder they get. It keeps the mind young.",4
"nice menus.. crisp clean colorful look..fun...I like it..I got it for free today but I would pay for this, worth the .99... I shared this with my wife and she got it also...",5
"constant misspellings within the app are a red flag (for me) and this title has plenty... also, too many permissions needed to run a simple game.",1
Great game while wait for events to start. My kids love playing it too. fun fun fun fun easy easy easy easy kids love kids love kids love,5
"Who ever knew this was a training application for valet drivers.  This bread and butter gets straight down to brass tacks and let's solve a billion puzzle scenarios in order to get that corvette back to wall street yuppie.  my only pita with this game is it needs a storyline,  something exciting.  heck maybe some bonus levels where you have to put it in a certain spot. Lacks drive but drives you insane as you go.  Great app in my book.",4
"If you like puzzle games, you'll love this one! This game will keep you busy for hours; Each puzzle is a different challenge.  I've even gotten my friends five year old grandson doing them & would probably be great to have on a road trip.",5
Tried to run on photon and it won't go past the intro. at last I didn't try and actually pay.,1
if you are a droid user one star this garbage app.  really your cheap game cant even run on a droid? Then go back and learn to develop the app correctly.,1
this game is wonderful. No issues with it crashing my phone or tablet. It offers a challenging yet fun game.,5
What happened to supermans reviews? I always read them in the morning when I first wake up! Games fine. I don't like using my mind though ;-),4
Similar to unlockit! and other slide maneuver puzzle games like QUELL. Challenging multi level puzzle with nice visuals and cool concept. Overpriced though @ $2.99.,4
"I am very picky about the apps I download,I read all reviews (love you superman75) and refuse 90% of the faotd...but I have enjoyed this game over all others I have...I have been playing it everyday since getting it,and decided it deserves a shout-out from me.....",5
i like these games. so i downloaded it regardless of me having a motorola droid and it worked. if it doesnt work for yours then dont rate low just cause of my comment.,5
This is a pretty fun game to play. I usually like puzzle type games. I got bored pretty fast but its a game to pay sometime.,3
this is a terrible product. I purchased this and when it arrived not only was the box ripped but inside the box was a 100 year old sock.,1
"its an okay app...not a must buy app,but if its for free for the day I will stick to it..:)",4
What a neat twist on a classic slide puzzle concept. Awesome fun playing and who of driving age cannot relate to a trafic jam?,5
Absolutely love this app!! It is challenging without being too difficult and there are plenty if puzzles and levels. Looks and works great on Kindle Fire.,5
other then misspelling asians this is a pretty cool game. a little racist but then again what isn't these days.,5
I really enjoy playing this game. Lots of difficulty levels and puzzles on each level....a real brain teaser! Love it!,5
this is just an average app. Would like to have had more data before use. Probably will not use it very much,2
"I like this game &amp; yes it does sorta mimic other puzzle apps but I'm basing my review on THIS game &amp; how enjoyable it is to play &amp; NOT what other apps it's similar to.And as entertaining some reviewers are, i.e. superman75 &amp; the superman wanna-bes, I'm making my 5 Stars to offset those who make feabile attempts at humor &amp; are not interested in an accurate, realistic review.",5
"This is a simple, yet fun puzzle game. Many one star reviews state that this game asks for too many permissions, but I do not see that on my version.",3
and yet entertaining. endless hours of brain numbing fun that will pass time well. should be available on every phone stock.,5
"If you were smart you wouldn't download this, way too many permissions.  If this game really does need those permissions say why in the description..",1
Love this app! Hours of fun! It is very addiciting! COuldn't go to sleep one night trying to solve a puzle I was stuck on!,5
A very good app for being &quot; the free app of the day&quot;. your really have to use your head for this app. good luck and have fun!,4
I have had hours of intertainment with this game it makes time just slip away. i play it when iam waiting for a appoitment. it keeps my mind busy all the time trying to figure out what move is next.,4
"I got as the free app of the day.  I hope that all of you who like a little challange, I say it is for you.",5
Love this app...simple but very entertaining....works good on my HTC evo view tablet. It has different levels so you won't be bored.,5
this is a game that is worth its price. there is more than 400 puzzles for this app. defently worth it. plus it was the faotd,4
Killed some time for me.  There are some difficult puzzles so this game would entertain every level.  I didn't feel it was a must have though.,4
just copy the example of this developer.. copy a popular game style then offer it for free.... how else does this developer make any money?  gee thanks amaz.... if u need a puzzle game so bad get infecct. but if u want to save a buck n get phone jammed up w puzzly mcspy app  by all means,1
"I love this app. Seems simple, just move the cars out of the way so your race car can get out of the parking lot. But it is a puzzler. Each level gets more difficult of course but if you get stuck you can just move on and go back to it later. It also keeps your score for each level so you can go back and try to beat it. This is the game I play when I want to relax, after Angry Birds gets my blood pressure up LOL.",5
I've never really cared for these types of games so I'm not really sure why I downloaded this on.  Probably because it was free.It's a lot like the block puzzle games you probably played growing up.  Seems to work pretty well and doesn't freeze much.  Good game if you like this type of puzzle.,3
This game is challenging and will keep me busy when I'm bored. Wish I can customize the car skin. Looking at the same cars get tedious.,4
"Graphics are crisp and clear on my Xoom tablet. Decent strategy game comparable to Unblock Me, the difference being the setting is on a street with an objective to clear vehicles so the red car can move freely to the exit. One of the better FAotD.",4
"So when was the last time you walked out of the supermarket and your car was stuck between 3 BMWs, 2 limos and 4 SUVs that all look exactly the same and you had to go and move the cars around and not only that, but the exit HAS to be RIGHT in front of the car, because apparantly your car cant turn, but it apparently can deny physics by sliding left and right with no turning? No? Maybe if you are God. This seems to be a puzzle game for God, as it is nothing we humans can relate to.Would be better if it were a bit more realistic and put blocks or a host of other things than cars.If you are God and can relate to this, then its not a bad game, but very simple and has no depth. Special abilities, new mechanics, etc.",3
Takes brains and skills. Good app. will keep this one for long time. Avise everyone to buy this app. Thanks,5
"I loved this puzzling challenge. The point of the game is to get the red car to the exit. Some levels are very difficult, but I think this is challenging for all minds!",5
"Boy I can't wait to start shuffling around all them Porches, Limousines, and BMWs. I always wanted to be a valet and gets rich folks cars. And once we get them cars out the parking lot, do we gets to go for a drive? No? Oh. We gets to go back in there and get another car. Sounds like great fun to me. Another reminder I's poor and drive a 86 Honda. Thanks!",5
"Reading some of the lame negative reviews on ""free app"" day, I almost didn't d'load it. I'm glad I gave it a try anyway. Can't figure out why anyone would rank this low, unless it just didn't work on their tablet or phone. Works great on Kindle Fire. Sort of difficult to put down, once I start playing the puzzles. Both in our family have enjoyed it already. I think this game is better on a tablet than paying 20 bucks for the plastic pieces and game cards for the board game.",5
"I am growing tired of the applications that ask for more permissions then they need, especially games. That is not acceptable. This must stop.",1
"Well, I played 40+ puzzles, I guess it can't be bad. You might almost call it addicting. :-) It is a decent puzzle game, but somehow it feels a bit overdone. Can a game be too flashy or frilly?Regardless, this game will keep you occupied. I haven't played any of the other traffic puzzle games to give an accurate comparison. But, if you like puzzles or puzzle games you won't be disappointed getting this one as Free App of the Day. Whether it's worth paying for compared to the free alternatives, I can't say.",4
"Although I got this free on Amazons Free App of the Day, I would gladly pay the buck for this many puzzles! The game is certainly fun &amp; addicting, no bones about it.I especially appreciated its thorough game settings &amp; instructions on how to play in the Menu. Many game apps lack this, making it difficult to play them.For those asking why &quot;the permissions&quot;? It's for sharing of your high scores online,  IF you chose to do so.If you like strategy type game puzzles then, I recommend giving this one a try.",5
Why does this app need to get your phone call information?  Don't install. A a a a a a a,1
I am amazed to see the number of levels this game provided.  Looks like it going to stay on my KF for a while.  Thanks!,5
great puzzle game for kindle. glad it was free app of day or I probly wouldn't have downloaded but I'm so glad I did.,5
Really entertaining and thought provoking logic based puzzle game with car theme. It gets progressively more difficult and has plenty of levels.,5
"sorry, but why does a game, that only involves moving around vehicles, need those kind of permissions? I know a few games that don't ask for anything.",3
There are too many people out there who will give up there info for a game that has no value to it at all.,1
I thought it would have been more challenging but never the less my 4 year old like the app and plays it a lot.,4
"My 4-year-old and his 6-year-old friend both love this game. It's loud, because the monkey tells the kids what to do next, but otherwise a nice way to distract them for 10-15 minutes.",5
This is a great value for just .99! My son is almost 3 and loves this app! It runs great and he just picked it up so quickly! I do wish the creator would have made the counting activity more challenging by giving more than needed so the child has to touch correct amount and not just everything there. But overall it is an amazing app!,5
My oldest son loved this app when it first came out almost two years ago (he was 3-1/2 at the time). He's too old for it now but now my 2-1/2 year old is thoroughly enjoying it! He loves to do the puzzles and count the fruits and pick a sticker.... it's amazing to watch what he learns from playing this. And it's very easy for small children to figure out. Well worth the money!,5
"one of the most annoying ways yup can entertain your kids.  the thing is that game keeps them interested for a long time, and it might even teach them something in the process.",5
"A lot of potential, as in room for growth for the older kids, maybe up to 5th grade? Even 3rd or 4th would be cool. Game is pleasing to the eyes and plays smooth. Kids love it.",5
We bought this on our ipad a while back.  It got so much play time I wanted to have a copy for the fire as well.,5
"My two year old LOVES this game and I'm so glad I purchased it.  So far, this is one of the best educational apps I've tried for Kindle Fire and it keeps his attention and interest because it rotates through different games and then rewards performance with ""stickers"" the child chooses for their wall.  VERY CUTE!",5
Fun and Easy for my 3 year old. Begs to play all the time helps with colors counting and puzzles,5
As long as you are looking for a kids game it would be fine. If you are looking for fun beyond age 3 I would pick a different game.,3
"My 3 year old really loves this game. It's very easy and fun for her to play. There are some very good skill building games (puzzle pieceing, color identification, etc). If you have small children, I would suggest getting this app for them.",5
"This app keeps them busy while learning, has puzzles, games and a lot of great learning stuff for them to do while they think they are just playing. Absolutely Recommend it",5
A wonderful quality app that with guidance can help you early learner learn the basics with a calm fun endless game of learning. Kudos to the developers for keeping quality and functionality on a higher level then most others care to aspire to.,5
Have a 2 and 4 year old and they both love the monkey. They would play for hours if I let them,5
I think its a good app to keep kids busy and use to using a touch screen device. My 2 year old grand daughter loves the little puzzles and picking the stickers.,4
"Just the right age group it was made for. My son is 2 and loves learning about the colors and numbers at the same time. I love that it has puzzle fruit, counting how many fruits go into the lunchbox, plus he's learning his small to biggest, and even his color groups. May not be a lot to some people, but it makes a little difference to a little person that loves learning everyday. I love this game for him and I have seen that he is learning a lot everyday.",5
My daughter enjoys playing this game. She likes the games and likes the rewards. Surprisingly she opens it up just about every time she's allowed to use my phone,4
The back and menu key do nothing but home does. That's apparently how one quits the game. It would be better if there were a code or something you have to tap like home three times or something.The images look good but when they animate they go fuzzy. Might not matter on a little telephone but on a tablet it's very noticeable.Worth getting.,4
"So the kids ALWAYS played this on my friend's iPhone. When we got them Kindle Fires, we downloaded it and away they wnt. They already know how to play and they so enjoy earning their stickers. I get tires of learning the annoying monkey, but they kids love him and are learning colors, numbers, shapes, etc., so I will deal with it.",5
"Every time I see my 3 year old niece, since I have downloaded this app, she has shouted that as she is running towards me- ""I want to play monkey!"" She has been playing this for about three weeks now, and I have noticed a drastic increase in her cognition- she is now able to keep focused and learn her numbers, colors, and different fruits. The fun monkey makes noises, keeps her engaged, and makes her laugh. The app has counting, matching, puzzles, colors, and a sticker feature as rewards. When she is done with her exercises, she loves picking out her sticker to ""put on the paper"" to show her mom and dad. It is so entertaining that the 6 and 9 year old want to play it lol. Great app and I'm so happy I found it!",5
My grandson is almost 3 and enjoys playing and learning at the same time. Fast paced to keep his attention.,5
"This app has a number of different activities: one where you practice counting by tapping on a certain number of pieces of fruit, one where you solve a four-piece jigsaw puzzle by dragging pieces into place, a tiny game of concentration with only eight cards, several activities where you look at four drawings and tap on the one that is different (for example it asks, ""touch the biggest grapes""), one where it asks you to tap on the fruit that starts with a particular letter, and one where it shows icons of eight different fruits and asks you to tap on the fruits that are a particular color.  After every few screens it asks you to pick a sticker to add to a page of stickers that you have earned.  The stickers accumulate until you exit the app.  Then they are gone.My toddler is really fascinated by this app and often asks to play with it.  The activities in this game are perfect for his level of development right now.I really like that it uses healthy fruit, not candy or other junk food.  There is so much junk food everywhere in our society that it is refreshing to see a game that encourages healthy eating.The only thing I don't like about this app is that it takes up a lot of space on my phone.  But I clicked on ""move this to my SD card"" and now there's plenty of space, and the app plays fine from there.(I don't have any connection with the makers of this game.  I'm just a satisfied customer.)",5
Very good clean app that helps kids actually learn. Also keeps them busy for a while. Works well on Kindle Fire.,5
Not fun,1
My two year old loves this! It keeps him entertained for quite a while. He loves the sticker reward! Super cute game.,5
"This game is an almost perfect preschooler game. The screens are high definition, colorful and the animation is well done. The point of the game is to complete a set of three challenges in order to be rewarded with the child's choice of a sticker. Then repeat. The challenges range from counting to matching colors or fruits to a simple puzzle to memory games. They rotate randomly. All the while a cute little monkey dances on the screen when your child is successful.It is easy enough for my 2yr old and captivating enough for my 5yr old. It works well on all my devices from Thunderbolt to Galaxy Tab to Bionic.Well worth the cost.",5
my 6 yr old and 3 yr old loved playing this with me. it was a savior while we were at a long dr. appointment. very cute and the kids love earning the stickers as a reward.,5
it is a great game I enjoy it so much because it teaches kids and keeps them occupied. I advise getting it for ur child.,5
"This was the first app I bought when I got my Kindle Fire. My daughter, who's 2, absolutely LOVES this game. She can easily play it all by herself and she enjoys getting the 'stickers ' when she finishes some games. No matter how many games I get for her, this is one of the few she keeps playing. Highly recommended!",5
"this is a good game for my 2 1/2 yr old. She is really figuring out how to play. its repetitive, but I think that's great for kids this age.",5
My daughter 4yrs has loved this app on both my wifes iPhone and my Android tablet.  She loves to play it and often times falls asleep in her car seat while playing it.  Worth the money.,5
"This review is from the free app of the day. Overall a really nice app that is toddler and preschooler friendly. As mentioned before, only the home button works. I understand keeping it simple, but options such as volume on/off, difficulty level, etc would be nice. Too easy for older kids, too hard for younger, fits a very narrow age and skill range.With a little refining this app would be worth purchasing. Until then it is a honestly a little expensive.3 stars for current version and price4 stars if price drops to $0.99 or app is updated.",3
"This app/teaching tool is excellent and highly recommended.  Exciting for 2 to 5 year olds.  The program constantly moves along keeping the child's interest while teaching them shapes, colors, matching, logic puzzles, and differences (big vs. small, etc.).  Well done and worth every penny! (Note to parents - turn the volume down as the background music gets annoying fast.)",5
"This program consists of about six single-screen puzzles, each with a few variations.  After about 10 minutes of play they begin to repeat.  As you move through the games there is no escalation in difficulty or any apparent attempt to select the ""next"" puzzle based on previous puzzles or the child's success at solving them.In our case my 4-year old daughter got bored even before the first sequence was completed.  A little ways after the puzzles began to repeat she closed the app and wanted to watch a movie.On the plus side, this app is ""solid"" (no bugs and with a finished appearance).  It also does *not* need any kind of Internet connection to run.  (Some reviewers said it did and I expect they may have been using an earlier version.)  Finally, it runs just fine on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.In summary, it is good for at least one fairly short sitting.",2
My daughter loves this app and it is very easy for her to navigate.  It makes learning fun for her.,4
"Good: My 3 year old loves it.  It was fun, interactive, and she got the concept quickly.  Graphics are cool, as are the sticker rewards.Bad: It does get repetitive at times, so a few more challenges or variety would be nice.  Also, it turns off your screen saver as well as your ability to exit the app, so the only way to stop it is to turn off the phone, turn the phone back on, and then kill it, so it's murder on your battery life.",4
Another fun learning game to the little ones. This one keeps you going for quite a while and teaches as you go. I am sure you would like it for your child or in my case my 3 yr. old grandson.,5
I have a three year old son who loves this program. His older brother has a lot of doctors apts and this little app keeps my little guy entertained while at the doctors. He's learning colors and sizes and loves the little puzzles.,5
"great design and very nice graphics. something the neice n nephew wouuld definitely enjoy spending time on!!! Dev needs an option menu/screen/exit (just a suggestion, ^_~) but overall wonderful appp!!!!!thanks so uch Amazon  for the free apps!!!",5
my 2 yr old loves the monkey and the stickers.  she can play for up to 15 min. before she moves on to something. else.,4
"My 3yr old stays entertained quite well with this game, bonus that it is educational. It cycles through a handful of games over and over; so although repetitive in one sense, it gives variety to keep him going without getting bored too quick.",5
"Cute monkey asks you do puzzles, count fruit,  match cards, identify colors, sizes etc. Kids win virtual stickers. It can be repetitive, but the little ones never seem to get bored of it.",5
My 18 month old grandson loves this application.  He is learning colors. numbers. counting. and more. He can't. wait to get to choose a sticker. He quickly got bored with some of the other apps. available. But so far so good with this one.  I wish there were more different activities. ...otherwise great. Thank you.,4
"These electronic devices are not toys, so why promote baby games for it.  Give your kids a set of blocks or teach them yourselves.",1
This is the 2nd learning game from this company  i downloaded. Always looking for learning games that will hold her attention. She loves these Monkey games.,4
This is a fun app for preschoolers and holds my 3yr old son's attention while also teaching him. Love it.,5
This is one of the best apps we have gotten. she loves it and the monkey is so cute when he flips. Totally keeps her attention while she is learning. Would get it again!,5
"This app keeps the grandkids busy and happy!  They just love to play with the monkey, and the 2 year old is learning his numbers and colors with it!",5
"My twin girls are 3 1/2 and they love this game. They are learning letters and numbers with reinforcement by playing the monkey preschool games. Now, if only I had 2 Kindle devices...",5
Got the app for my 2yr old. when he first started to play he started laughing hysterically! He loves when the monkey flops around because he did good. The games are fun and informative and the graphics are cute. overall great app.,5
There is plenty of variety and she even gets things wrong on purpose just to hear the game talk to her! She really reacts with laughter and glee when she plays this game.,5
grandson loves it. nice of Amazon to offer it for free. works fantastic on my Android. color and animation is great.,5
It is a good app. Needs to include a coupld more games and a way to close out of it without having to force close it would be nice.,4
Yes these electronic devices are  really nothing more than expensive toys.  All one has to do is look at most of the apps in any app store. What are they?  Games. Toys.,3
"This is great. Keeps little ones busy and they learn as they enjoy the game. Teaches colors, names of fruits, numbers and some easy puzzles too...make more apps like this please.\n",5
I would have gave it a 3.5 star rating but there is no such monster.  The rating gets reduced exclusively for the lack of progress save.  Why collect stickers if you lose them by the wrong press of a button?  My four year old was entertained but he dropped the screen and the progress 3x in 8 minutes.  Not cool!,3
"Love this app! My grand son loves playing it and very educational for learning numbers, letters, and shapes for small children.",5
Even dough I'm a kid I'm not giving it 1 star I say 5 but it cost 2 dollers so i say 3 but not so much stuff so now its 1 but its good for learning(baby's)so its 2 :)-,2
I really like the Monkey Preschool apps for my one and a half year old daughter.  The graphics are so much fun and the games are very educational.  The only downfall is I wish there were more different 'games' in each section.,4
THINK THAT IT IS STUIP THAT I HAVE TO SEPEND HAVE A DAY DOING THIS. IT WAS FUN. MY 5 YR LIKE IT. JUST GREW OUTTA OF IT,3
"This covers the basics that preschoolers need to work with.  Letters, colors, shapes, matching things.... I think this is great!  However, on my EVO 4G the lunchbox I was supposedly filling was just a pixelated jumble and every now and then something would appear above the monkey, again pixelated, so I couldn't tell exactly what it was.",4
"My youngest, 4, loves this app. We do not play very many electronic games, however, the ones we do play are educational. This one fits the bill and it is fun. There is counting, matching, size differentiation, colors, letters, and puzzles. Plus, at the end you get a *sticker*. Ages 2-4 will be best suited for this app. Fun learning is always a good thing.",5
"My granddaughter has been playing with this app since she was one. She is now two and still enjoys playing with it.  The games are easily at a two year old skill level.  My granddaughter finds the icon and starts playing on her own. The kids are rewarded with virtual stickers when they do well.  We have it on on iPad, Kindle and phones.  Great game. I recommend it.",5
she loves to play this game and it is hard to get her to stop. my children fight over my fire to play thanks for the great app,5
"My 4 yr old loves this game, she'll steal the wifes nook color and play it for an hour or more at a time. Now the dev just need to push some updated content",4
My 3 yr olds favorite game! It's the first one he asks to play. He loves the music. Great learning game.,5
"my three year old loves this game very very much! she thinks shes playing a game, while shes actually learning in the process!!!",5
My son  LOVES THIS  app. I heard about it through his preschool teacher and it definitely delivers on fun and a variety of activities to help your child learn.,5
"I am not going to keep this app because I have no use for it, but I just wanted to say that it looks really fun. Might be nice for the little kids who are always stealing my phone because it's &quot;cool&quot;, lol. It would give them something constructive to do.",4
"The game is very cute. It runs through a series of challenges for a pre-schooler to solve. Unfortunately, the apparently random nature of the challenges being offered do now allow a child to progress from easy to hard problems in the various categories. It gets quite tedious quickly and did not really teach the player anything new.",3
My 3 year old son likes it. It's good to keep him entertained while I'm in a meeting or trying to cook.,4
Put this app on my kindle because he was playing it on his mothers iphone.  He would say &#34;Want to play monkey game&#34;,4
"I think this game is definitely preschool level.  My kindergartener is not interested in it, he played for a short while but soon tired of it, but my 3 year old really enjoys it.Once you win a level in this game you get to pick a sticker.  My three year old enjoys coming over to me and showing me the stickers he has won.I got this app for the kindle fire and I have never had any problems with it.",5
"First, I love that NO permissions are required for this application -- wish more were like that.  My 4 yo loves the games, and the monkey cracks him up with his happy flips and antics. I like the educational aspect; the games teach colors, counting, matching and more. Works perfectly on my DROID R2D2. If you have little ones,  grab it now!!!",5
I bought this for my granddaughter when I was with her last weekend. We both had fun playing it and I had to sneak my Kindle away from her so I could go home.,5
I really love this app and so does my son! Its fun and educational! Which is the type of game I prefer he play if he is going to be on my Kindle Fire. Sooooworth the $1.99!!!,5
"My little boy has down syndrome....he loves this game...works it all by himself...navigates from screen to screen, chooses his stickers and gets so excited when he hears &quot;good job!&quot;......highly recommend for any child!",5
"She is very good at this one. She knows her colors, numbers and shapes. This game re enforces all she has already learn.",5
"This app works fine. I gave it four stars because there is no option to work on one kind of game at a time.To all the teenagers that rated the app one star because they are mad it is a kids game, get a life.  You need to rate apps based on their quality in that category and for giving the user what it said it would. This is for adults to entertain their children with. And I really wish everyone would stop whining about amazon, it is old, this isn't a forum for you to bit.. about amazon and what free app they are giving you, it is a place to rate said app.",4
great app for kids. my niece who is 3 learned her color with this and the two year old is watching and learning what she does...overall great game wish there was more,5
My kids are able to use this game with ease. there are great simple games that even my three year old can play without any help. And he is learning his letters and how to spell words....that is ahead of the curve if you asked me!!!,5
"Kids seems to like it, but doesn't play very much.  The best part is typing extra words to make sure this fills up the area, like doing an essay or something.",4
My granddaughter enjoys this one a lot.  It's really cute.  She likes getting the stickers.  It's a positive game that rewards kids efforts.,5
"My son loves the game, but I think the other Monkey game helps him learn more.  He may like the other more because he really likes sea creatures.",3
This game is our 2 year old sons favorite kindle fire game right now. He loves to pick a sticker and count the fruits. It has taught him how to use a touchscreen really well.,5
My daughter got a kindle for Christmas. Wanted to get here some free apps to try things out and this was very cute.,4
My daughter loves this. Got the idea from my sister yo get this app. Her son plays with it to,5
"my daughter loves this game.  definatelly worth $1.99.  it would be 5 stars if it had more activities and harder challenges.  it will taech basic alphabet recognition, colors, basic puzzles, and memory games.  looking forward to other titles.",4
"So cute. My 3 year old started playing when she was two. It gives frequent&#34;sticker&#34; rewards which helped keep her interested and teaches matching, comparing, memory tasks, and colors. There are enough activities for it to take awhile before they master the whole app.",5
"This game really helped my daughter with counting, putting together the puzzles, shapes, and colors.  This game has taught her a lot.",5
"This is a cute game and very educational. However, it is repetitive by repeating the same activities just with different content. My 3year old lost interest rather quickly.",4
"my son will spend 30 minutes at a time accumulating tons of stickers for his hard work. Such an educational, engaging, and fun app for kids!  Would like to see the stickers somehow stay perpetual, though, to let my son see the fruit of his labor over time.",5
"My 4 year old daughter loves this app.  It is cute ,and fun, and she is learning sight words, etc.  She is having fun and secretly learning, what could be better?  It runs well so I bought the additional Monkey Preschool Apps too.  Well done!",5
"I got this app when it was free, but it is definitely worth the $2 asking price. Interface is pretty solid, colors are bright, voices are annoying; all the things that hold a child's attention. I feel this does a good job of teaching simple shapes, colors, and counting.Basically this is a collection of mini games for your little one. Every few mini games, it rewards you with a sticker, which you paste on a wall and immediately go back to mini games. Shape puzzles are smooth and easy for my three year old, counting is maybe a little automated as it doesn't encourage you to follow along as it counts when you tap the fruits. It is educational until your little angel can count to 20 on his or her own, but even then it's entertaining and anything that buys me an extra ten minutes of peace at the grocery store check-out is worth two bucks!",5
My son loves playing this.  I like that he is learning different things and he really enjoys it.  If I had onecriticism it would be that the game keeps doing the same things over and over but my son doesn't seem to mind at all.,5
My grand daughter loves this game. She even laughs when she has a wrong answer and the monkey shakes his head no.,4
This has several games that are easily done by two year olds.  It is repeatedly selected from other choices available on the kindle.,5
This is such a cute app. Very colorful and lively. Easy challenges for beginners. All around fun game for little ones.,5
"I missed the chance to download this for free, but still think it was worth the money. My boys fight to play this. Very cute.  Would love to see a more advanced version.",4
"I teach a preschool class, and I think this is the most helpful app I have. When there are only a few kids waiting to be picked up at the end of the day,we go bananas for this game. :)",5
I bought this May 2011 and my 3.y.o twins still love it and ask to play it all the time. Great game!,5
"Colorful,fun entertainment for my 16 Month granddaughter.Good start in learning numbers,matching,,shapes,and sometimes.Earning the stickers at the end of the course is a nice reinforcement.",4
In past I downloaded many apps that I considered interesting but my child did not want to play. This one is for sure one of her favorites. It has just right level of difficulty for 3 years old. Also quality of graphics and sound is very good.,5
This is a great game for preschoolers. My granddaughter and I have a lot of laughs playing this game. She loves the part where we get to pick the stickers.  The graphics are very good and the monkey is adorable. Great app for the little ones.,4
"I got this for my boys as they are both preschool age and they both enjoy playing it. I wish they were more options for even more levels but for it being free, I can't really complain.It's educational and cute and it really holds their interest.",5
i so wish the creator of this app had more out there for kindle fire. we just love this game. our son plays it all the time and is already memorized fruit sight words. he is 3 and autistic and just started talking but he can already recognize the names of fruits even without the photos! he loves it and we love that hes learning!,5
"My toddler loves this game!  Even my 4 year old will play it.  The games include things like puzzles, a matching game, finding the biggest or smallest item.  The games cycle through and after 5-6 games the kid gets to pick a sticker to put on their sticker board.  Cute animations and fun music.",5
My three and a half year old son loves this game.  It works great my tablet running 3.1.  I have a hard time getting my Transformer back when he plays this game!,5
"This is the best learning app I have come across for todlers.  My 2 year old loves it.It has games with memory, shapes, colors, letters.  My child doesn't get bored with it.",5
"Cute idea- downloaded for my 3 and /or 5 year old - thing is...there is no variety so they become bored very quickly. There are different activities, yes, simple puzzle, colors,  letters and a few more - however you cannot pick what you want to play as they are randomly set up and delivered in groups of 5-6 games or so per round of play -after each round you get a little sticker to place on a board - stickers are cute and fun idea - however they are not saved (no option)  and you start with blank board each time you begin play --would have been better if u could keep the stickers in a little album or something. - After about 5 rounds of playing I noticed games were repeating,  after about 10 rounds my daughter noticed - just not enough variety or options for a paid app - or an app for kiddos with minimal attention spans!!! I use on Kindle Fire and as with other reviews I read I do not have to be connected to Wifi to play- can play in car, on the go no prob.",2
This is the only learning app my three year old can just pick and play without my help. Within a week hes already learner he basics and can now differentiate between letters even when they're different colors.  pretty amazing.,5
"My four year old liked it. It's not hard, but it teaches matching and keeps her entertained!! It's really cute!",5
Sort of repeats the same things over and over.I have used this with my grandson.  He likes it alot.  I like to have children's items on my Kindle.,3
My 2 year old loves this app. Wish there were more from this developer for his age and skill level.,5
"We have another Monkey game and enjoy it. This is a new today app for us, but fun so far. Not my kid's first choice to play, but they do like it when they do.",4
"I check the free Apps daily and have been looking for one that my granddaughter can play and learn from without having to pay for something she may not enjoy.  This looks like great fun for her, thanks for including the little ones.",4
My 2-year old can sit and play this game for 30 minutes straight - if you have a 2-year old - you know that's saying a lot! He loves the games. The wonderful thing about this game is that it rotates through mini-games so the little ones don't get bored with one type of game. The games incorporate lots of learning - so it's a win-win.,5
my 4 1/2 year old really likes this game.  it seems to keep her busy and it's a game she can really play and understand on her own.  her friend had it and so she wanted it and she really enjoys it.,5
My kids enjoy playing this game. Fun music and graphics. Great for 3 year old and 5 year old kids.,5
"Probably my daughter's favorite ipad app, now she can play on my droid. so glad to not have to pay for it twice thanks to amazon appstore today!",5
"My 3 year old lives this app. Its probably a little too easy conceptually for most preschoolers, but its a fantastic tool to get them used to touch screens.",5
"I picked this one up for my kids to learn touch gestures on the XOOM tablet.  Both my 3 year old and 5 year old enjoy it.  It has a few different game modes (find the biggest/smallest, drag to complete a puzzle, place stickers, find all objects of the same color, counting, and a small memory-type game).I haven't had any technical issues with it on my Thunderbolt or XOOM.  Hopefully a future update will bring a broader set of objects and games (I'm worried that the kids will tire of the small set of images and sounds).",4
Great game. My 18 month-old son is addicted to this game. I have to tell him that the Kindle needs to &#34;nap&#34; to get him to put it down. He is learning a lot of wonderful things from this game.,5
"I don't know what it is about this game that little kids are drawn to but I know my 3 year old is crazy about Monkey Preschool Lunchbox. It is essentially the same few pages of activities that rotate through, then at the end of each set they get to pick out stickers to put on a board -- well you know kids love stickers! I think that is their motivation for completing the activities. Activities include color sorting, counting and putting puzzles together.",4
Got this for the grandkids and they liked it right away. My 3 year old twins can enjoy it as well as the 5 yr old.,5
if you have a child between the ages of 11/2 -5 this is the.app for them .My daughters love this app and so do i.well worth the purchase price.,5
This is a very cute and age appropriate game for toddlers. My son just turned 2 and loves this game. He is already a master at all the puzzles and matching game.  I recommend highly! And provides much needed electronic entertainment when we are out and about!,4
"This adorable monkey has become a favorite of my little grandkids!  He challenges the children to count various items, play &#34;matching&#34; games, and identify letters.  Each correct answer rewards the monkey with some food for his lunchbox. The monkey squeals with delight and jumps around each time he catches more food.  This game is wonderful in every way, perfect for the tiny preschoolers.",5
"Grandson in preschool just loves this game and always plays this one first. So many to choose from he tells me, he loves them all, but keeps coming back to this one. Yes, NANA approved! :LOL",5
"This is a great download for the pre schooler.  I downloaded it when my grandchild was not yet three and she loved it.  It has a variety of games having to do with colors, counting, etc.  It lets them pick a sticker when they get so many correct and a board to stick them on.  A really cute game and it is random as to what game is coming up next so you do not get sick of any one thing. I would recommend.",5
"my daughter loved it when she played it, but outgrew it pretty fast.  it was a good way to occupy her for a little bit if needed.",5
"great game, my daughter loves it, very educational, worth the money. keep up the good job guys. I will buy more products from this producer",5
"Very educational! Matching fruits, Letter id,  much more. Also very simple for preschoolers,and beginning kindergarden.. Gives praise to kids thru cute little monkey, has music Would recommend!!",5
"I should have reasd the blurb b4 downloading...i totally didnt notiice it was a learning tool for children. haha. looks great for preschoolers as a learning too, however slightly simple.kids are MUCH mored advanced these days, my siter &amp; her class are bilingual already (shes 8yrs old) and have been doing algebra since second grade so this app could be more advanced. a great start none the less",4
My 2 year old grandson loves playing this so much that I told his parents they need to get him a kindle so they can put games on them.,5
"No annoying ads, no forced reviews, very animated, easy for my child to continue having fun with, younger child (18 mos) needs a little guidance but learns quickly. Interactivity is also forgiving of slight mistakes and its not frustrating for either of my kids.Good stuff, glad I bought it!",5
"I haven't played this game, but I'm rating high to combat the earlier reviewer who was upset this was the free app of the day. Just because you aren't happy with the free app chosen doesn't mean you should negatively rate the app, which only harms the developer.",5
"My older daughter loves this game.  I don't know what draws her to it, if it's the graphics or the sounds, but she did learn how to match objects for other games I got later based on this one.  At 2 years old, this game drove her to figure out how to understand matching fruit and with other games she never really cared.  I don't like the short 10-second recycled music song that constantly plays (it's not annoying, just too short), but the animation works well and it has a lot of variety.  Great job on the developer part for getting this ""formula"" right.",5
"This game is great for toddlers. Even though it's way too easy for her now, she still goes back to play it and it makes a good distraction in a car ride as it is the only one of the monkey apps that works on my cellphone.",5
"This app is very engaging for toddlers and they love to repeat the skills. They can learn shapes, colors, counting, and more.The only concern I have is that it does not exist like most Android apps. The only exit is with the ""home"" button.",4
Great game for my 2 year old son.  Simple yet not too simple.  He loves it.  Getting reward stickers helps keep him interested.  Overall super!,5
Worth the $1.99 - works great on my G2 and Acer tablet.  My daughter loves to play this game.  My only issue is that it doesn't have a clean way of exiting the game.,4
I  like this game! My son is almost 4 and loves this game..I do think it could be a little more challenging for him..Maybe making levels of difficulty would make it perfect!,4
"My 3 year old granddaughter had lots of fun with this game; however, since she is preschool ready, although not attending yet, she zips through all the games.  She lost interest after a few rounds.  BUT, I would not dismiss this app because children learn differently, and your child/grandchild may have hours and hours of enjoyment from learning from all the puzzles/games.  The monkey is fun to watch by itself as well.  A great buy and well-worth it!",5
"5 year old grandaughter who will start kindergarten liked this app for several days and it kept her busy for part of a long aiplane flight. It was a bit on the easy side for her and she has since gone on to other apps.There are other reviews that tell exactly what this app does.  It can be a nice fun learning opportunity for a child.Grandaughter does like earning the stickers!UPDATE:  2 year old triplets first time on my phone. Not everything was mastered the first time, but they loved this app!!Update:  After using this probably twice a week for 6 weeks or so, the triplets have totally mastered this.  While they still enjoy it for a short time, they are moving on to other apps.  Would love suggestions for suitable apps to try.",5
"Out of all the things I have put on my Kindle this is by far the best.  A fellow teacher had her son and mother-in-law with her at school one day.  My grandson is the same age as her son.  We were talking about apps and games for our three-year-olds.  Her mother-in-law recommended this game.  I got it for my grandsons (both age 3) to play when visiting. After my son saw it he purchased it for his son.  It is educational, fun and they learn to play it as they go.  This should be a must on every tablet, computer or other device if you have preschoolers.",5
"Granddaughter loves this application, this can keep her entertained for hours . she always wants to know what is next and what sticker she can use",5
"The kids in my family love this game.  Bright, colorful, and educational.  Teaches counting, colors, and lots more! Good for a variety of ages.",5
"This was a good choice for my two year old. It is easy enough she can do it by herself but also is a good learning tool. It keeps her attention, I would  highly recommend this game",5
its a good game for kindergarten or a little younger. the only way to get out of it is to hit your home button though.,4
"i got this for my two year old recently. at first i had to help her alot. out of no where she just picked it up and can put the fruit back together and match up cards on the memory game, etc. it actually makes me so happy and proud as i watch her learn with this game. i did get this when it was on sale making it that much more awesome. but i would say its even worth full price!",5
My four year old granddaughter loves this game!  She played it for hours on my Kindle.  Excellent preschool game and learning computer skills game.,5
"My four year old son likes this game but really failed to learn much. He is a bit old for most of the content and since he has been in Preschool since he was 2, finds this a little boring. Less repetitive content would be better and as a few have said, save features would be nice and ability to keep home keys locked out during play so they don't exit accidentally would have earned out another star.",3
"My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter absolutely loves this app. It keeps her entertained for quite a while- great for boring Dr appointment waits or whatever. She needed a little help with the puzzle part at first, but she's getting the hang of it now.",5
My 2year old daughter likes the game but it didn't keep her attention as long as I had hoped. The game is a good educational activity but it doesn't have many varieties of activities. It repeats itself too quickly and didn't keep her attention.,4
I haven't really spent much time on this app. My 4-year-old loves it and it gives stickers for playing games right. she enjoys that. She likes the puzzles too.,4
"my 2yr old sons love it, but they do consistently reset it by inadvertently hitting the home or back button.",4
"I bought this for my to keep her busy when we are appointments or places where she can't run all over the place. It works in a way, she loves playing the game, but also gets very excited and loud sometimes. It is a winner with me.",5
"One of my grandkids is a big Curious George fan so I had to give this game a try and cannot help but compare to theJumpstart Preschool 1 Free - Preschool Educational Appgames.  What I like about these games are that they help with counting skills and matching games that the Jumpstart games do not provide.  In addition, the puzzle game in Monkey Preschool is much easier to pick up; in the Jumpstart puzzle game you are allowed to pile puzzle pieces on top of each other and on top of the pattern so that key clues are covered.  With the Monkey Preschool, the pieces snap back to the pickup pile and do not become piled up so all the pieces are out in the open and easy to compare with the pattern.  Although the Jumpstart games are a lot of fun, the Monkey Preschool games have an overall edge in ease of learning the concepts and in the breadth of skills.",5
"loves this game.  Even tho it's really too young for her (she's 7), she loves it anyway because it is easy!",5
"5 stars all the way. why would someone give it 1 star just because its a child's game. the name is not misleading. I agree that its a good thing you don't have kids. anyways, it works great.",5
"The Monkey Preschool apps are simply some of the best apps for your young children. I have not went wrong with any of the Monkey Apps, my daughter loves them and they are really just wonderful for Preschool age.",5
"Monkey Preschool Lunchbox is a great little game for your smart little gamers.  The colors are bright, the content is good, and it holds my sons attention really well.  Only warning to parents is that the sound is very lively and can get grating after a while (can be mitigated by turning the volume down of course.) Runs great on Atrix and Samsung Galaxy S II.",5
"The children have to listen to directions and receive positive feedback. Great for colors, counting and I like the fruit puzzles!",5
"My 4-year-old loves this app; it reinforces what she learns in preschool(colors, letters, counting, etc)n  This WOULD be 5-stars except for what others have said: exits too easily &amp; exiting causes you to lose all the stickers you earned. Should be a little more &quot;childproof&quot; especially considering the title, but overall a good app",4
"Decent app for the kids.  Gets a bit repetitive after a bit, but the three year olds don't mind.  Solid average app.",3
My 2yo daughter loves this. Its perfect how it moves from one puzzle to the next. Its keeps her attention and she is learning. She gets super excited when she earns a sticker.,5
"Kids like it and it's educational. It's not real challenging and after awhile the same questions repeat so the answers are predictable. It would be nice if the questions could be at least random or even better, designed to advance with skill levels.",5
We saw a little girl playing this in doctors office. So i read reviews right there and purchased for my 20. mo old. We both love it great sound and graphics we enjoy the preschool lessons she smiles as she plays it. A good buy for young kids,5
Such entertaining things to do for the youngsters in your life!!  Highly recommend this game for your preschoolers!!Nice job!!,5
my 3yr old's ability to match and do puzzles really came from playing this game.he loves it and it has given him the confidence to want to try harder puzzle and matching games.big thank you to MPL!!!,5
both my children LOVE this game.  I can always rely on this game to entertain them both.  They enjoy the images and the stickers.,5
A day ago 4 red dots were close to meI still remember who died in the family rest there soulsBut it's kind of freakish...I don't care if it's fake or notIt's entertainment,5
A friend had downloaded it and suggested I do the same while we were hanging out at her house. We were wondering if there was some sort of GPS/location based algorithm so we ran it at the same time and didn't get nearly the same readings. I guess the 'spirits' were more in tune with her phone :),3
"A friend of mine downloaded this app for his smart phone, so I thought I'd try it. Not as fun as it looked.",2
"a fun app for a one time try---may work better with a tablet than the phone a voice does manifest itself from time to time, but it difficult to understand.",3
"Again, worthless app.  No instructions given on how to use.",1
"apparently, my ghost only knows pppppaaaall and kkkkkk.. interesting..... maybe I can teach her/him some proper English. would be fun if it.actually said words.",3
"A red dot poped up next to me then it showed green in my kitchen, the word monkey poped up and I've been looking around like crazy to see if there's a monkey on anything. There's alot of fake animals in my house so I thought it could b that cause I have little elephants and giraffes and horses! I think you shouldn't get It if easily spooked like me, I'm going to delete it, I just don't know what to do. :/",3
As soon as I turned it on I heard see then it said nuts okay... then it said please. I have a polite perverted ghost.,5
"at first I was hessitant to try this app, but after reading the reviews I decided to try it out.  Iagree with the viewers, this app is surprising!I turned it on the other morning and the first thing it says is &quot;John&quot;...wow that's my husbands name, it scared me so I turned it off and called him right away.This app is to coinsedential...and serves its purpose for what it does.I rated it 4 stars because it takes long at times.",4
at first I was so confused but I got the hang of it.see here's the thing how do we know that it real because as I was reading the reviews it said that they said song red and other things.that was so funny to me because they say the same thing to me. I'm not saying that people don't say the same things at the same time.what I am saying is that as I read the reviews and play this so-co game I can tell that it uses the same words.don't beloved nh option. just saying until we gather enough evdinfe than MAYBE we could belinlve that it is true until then I Robt think so.otherwise it is a fun so -go game u should downloaded it,5
Awesome app what do the the dashes and letters mean can anyone give me answers please I found a spirit though,5
"Being a bit into the spirit world myself, this was a fun app to have. I also have a friend who is in touch with spirits and uses this same app. It's also fun to use at night and see if any messages come through.",4
by talking to them u are inviting them don't get it I beg u please!!!it scared me so much when a red dot appeared in my friends house the next day her whole kitchen was destroyed please don't get it,1
"Coolest ghost app ever! It is real too, I was sitting in my bean bag chair and I had it on, my little sister had spilled chips on the floor, the ghost radar said robot, which freaked me out because we have an electronic robot that cleans, and it was on. It also said stepped, and as I was going to tell my mom, I stepped in the chips! Another experience I had, I was on the couch, and my mom said to my baby sister, oh I need to change you! I had the radar on and it said, diaper and stink, and my sister stunk! So, if you believe in ghosts, get it! If you don't maybe you will! This is a 100 star worthy app!",5
creepy as can be. it said smoething was up staires and the Tv turned on after I had it turned off.,5
"Don't really know what to say about this one... the kindle fire is not exactly built with quality ghost electricity detection capabilities.  Still, it is a fun little program on Halloween night when exploring a spooking location, or if you want to make yourself hyper-aware at one o'clock in the morning and have nightmares.",4
First I thought that I didn't have ghosts but when I was taking my kindle downstairs  2 blobs came on and 1 of them turned blue and when I got 2 the 5th step it disappeared. That scared the crap out of me because I did think that the stairs were a little spooky.,4
"First time I turned it on it had a bunch of readings about teriyaki, then my parents brought home teriyaki... then it said a weird word that I looked up, it ment ringing of bells, and I was ringing a bell... then I went to my friends house and she thought her house was haunted, turned it on and waited for it to get used to the house, started out ok then, it said I control we and a bunch I mean a bunch of red dots appeared, I turned it off because my friend was scared to death, then I turned it back on an hour later and it said demon and had a red dot right behind me... never using it again...",5
For a free app does what is it designed to do and ended up buying the Legacy version. Thank You!,5
"From what ive heard, these ghost word generators can be eerily accurate, which may be a sign of true paranormal activity. It could just be plain cooincidence too. Either way, ask your friends about personal ouija board experiences. Using Ouija boards have been reported to cause anything from hauntings to possesion, and honestly what is a ouija board but cardboard with numbers and letters drawn on it? My point is, using things for the intent of talking to otherworldly creatures might bring trouble your way...especialy on a computer program like this. Also, the battery life issues are probably just the program using alot of power, but ghosts reportedly drain battery power, so it could be a sign of true activity if the power gets low while getting accurate word hits.",3
"Fun game to see if there are ghosts around the house, I tried it at a cemetery, none shown there.",5
"Fun idea, but obviously not legit.  I was really hoping that I would get some answers - but what more can you expect from a free App..?  I'm enjoying watching the kids scratch their heads over why the ghosts in the house are saying &#34;Union&#34; and &#34;Cup&#34; and &#34;Europe.&#34;  Ha!",4
Fun little app! Nothing to take seriously but fun to spook out your friends. I like to take it out when I'm walking around outside. It's fun but again it's just for fun. I can see where people may take it to heart and get freaked out. It's just an app and something to pass the time (like a game)!,4
Good game for someone looking for fun.Doesn't really work.WARNING could scare younger kids.Good game for about 14and up. My daughter and her friend played this game and got so scared they stayed huddled there all night.,4
"Gosh, is this spooky? I always thought that our bus was Haunted! I took this amazing app and watched it detect 3 ghosts. One said RUN. One said LEAVE. One said GO. Wow!",5
"Got a good laugh at a green &amp; the word cream in the living room?? Got 2 blue dots &amp; the word highway in the office, red dot &amp; pilot in the bedroom, 2 blue dots &amp; reach in the playroom!!?? What's all that supposed to mean??? It will amuse my 5 year old, because she wants ghosts to live with us, no she can &quot;find&quot; them!!!;p",3
"I always enjoy watching Ghost Adventures and The Dead Files so downloaded this free for the fun of using it. When my son used it he got some action and a few words so he enjoyed playing with it. When I used it nothing, but still one of those things that is fun to pull out when you are bored to waste a little time. We have not tried it outside the home. I would like to point out that even the expert ghost hunters don't get action everytime they do a lockdown at a location so just have fun with it!",4
"i am an amateur medium /ghost hunter.i decided to put this app to the test at an old grave yard in my cousins neiborhood.we checked some of the dates out. some dated back to the civil war times.so we turned the app on.the first word that popped up was died.the the second word was gun.sure enough,the grave that we checked out said the man had died by a gun...crazy...",5
I bought this app thinking it wouldn't work but it did. I had a friend over and we took it upstairs. The only bad thing is that the word was death. It freaked my friend out and she never went near this app again. But it's really fun and it's worth the buy.,5
"I bought this thinking I would delete it, but it turns out it is very good. I opened the app, then the word fire appeared on the screen. two days ago my dad told me that there was a fire in the house next door. BUY THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"I do not believe in ghosts because they are not real, but this thing is really a funny little gadget that is good for messing with friends, and it is free so that is good.",4
I do not care if this was really working like it said it was supposed to. It was just a fun app to have.,4
I do not really get the point. I sat there and nothing happened. if it was better designed it might be better.,2
I don't know if it's real or not but I like to use it to freak out the kids. lol,4
"I don't necessary believe it, bit things happened that could be debatable. I walked onto my parents room and my grandfathers ashes are in that little golden container thingy that they get put in and I put on the radar and it just about went crazy. and it said grandpa on the screen. so I ran out of the room creeped out, like a lot.another time it said Texas on the screen, this is stupid but Texas was thr answer to a game I was playing later.I wouldn't say I'm totally convinced, but its more like 50/50",4
I don't really believe in ghosts but after this app I might. So first we had a power outage and it ended up saying &quot;solar&quot; then &quot;mistake&quot;. Also it said &quot;Christmas&quot; and I know that Christmas is coming up. Plus I was in a room at night with my friends and it said &quot;visitor&quot; so we got scared and went into the kitchen and my friend was messing around with a bucket then it said &quot;bucket&quot; which also creeper me out but I think it's worth it and pretty fun but at night it can definitely give you a scare.,5
I downloaded it in bed and started it up... the first word it said was darkness. I decided to turn the light on at that point.,5
"I downloaded this and was sitting on my couch. nothing was going on so I turned off my kindle fire but the app was still running.  as I was going downstairs it said &quot; connected &quot; I didn't know that it talked so iwas freaked out and ran away. after making sure the app was closed I went back yo the stairs and saw my sister's ipod. weird. I continued down the stairs to get my ferret. her name is snickers. I Used to have a ferret named giggles. she died in her cage. but when I was by her cage the words &quot; giggles, owner, friend, and cage &quot; SHowed up but there was only one dot right where I found here. a very cruel coincident I would say.",5
I enjoyed reading all the reviews and that is the only reason I gave it a try. it said won-border-attack so obviously I am going to cancel my trip to Mexico after I win it!!!!,4
I found it ridiculous. For entertainment purposes didnt entertain. The app is a silly attempt to play on the growing interest in the paranormal.,1
"I gave it 3 stars just because its interesting. but because of the kindle fires lack of sensors, it.doesn't really work",3
I gotta say it is a little spooky. I'm a truck driver and i downloaded this app while i was sitting in a shop parking lot. the first thing it said was parts. then it said p and kept putting the letter p across yeah i really had to bad. i went to find an mt trailer and it said flat and research. didn't. find a flat but when i checked inside trailer i found a huge hole in the roof. if I'm to believe what they say there were a few ghosts around too. I do believe in ghost but i'll have to do a little more researching to see if this is really a reliable ghost detector. all in all it is an interesting app.,4
"I got the app and I lost my phone in my room and the app said I'm,missing,warn,radio,many,lower,taste,valuable,and cry and the spooky thing is I was sad and did cry a little my phone is valuable I have eaten food in my room (taste) my room is in the lower part of my house and I have a radio and last but not least I'm missing my phone this is creepy",4
"I got this, and it was talking away. I don't know if it is real but some things it says are just too relevant. Get it and try and see what you think. I got this one and liked it so much I moved on to the $1.99 upgrade and I am very pleased with all the extras it has. I still use this one. My friends are really interested to see it. This version is easy to use. I said some things after I asked a question, and they were right on the money. Creeepy!",5
"I got this app after looking at other people's reviews. I am a total believer when it comes to spirits. According to the radar, I had like 6 ghosts in my house. They started saying stuff that didn't make sense. But seeing those words and looking at the radar scared the s*** out of me. Because I'm a believer, this scared me so badly, I'm afraid to use it again. The only reason I want to use it still is so I can maybe communicate with my dad. Only 4 stars because it's so freaky.",4
I got this app and  a ghost was in the living room and then my dog started barking then I looked down and the red dot disappeared and my dog stopped barking it freaked me out. GET THIS GAME if you have a dog then if you hear it barking then look down if you see a dot you know it's a ghost,5
"I got this app and was at my friends house. her ghosts are way too talkative! it said bark, frozen, car, coffee, spread, dust, total, pool, we've, kids, find, having, slight, dollar, ability, matter, fur, without, ordinary, combination, pig, California... her mom was making bacon when it said pig though. it scared us and we ran out of the house to mine and ate doritos.",4
"I got this app because I live in a slightly haunted house. I used this and it told me there was a &quot;ghost&quot; around me. The truth that it is real or not? I don't know, but its a good time waster and neat to show to my freinds and family.",5
"I got this app because my friend recommended it. When I opened it I soon got the words (In the order I got them) store, Both, adult, children. I don't know what it means, but it did slightly creep me out.",4
"I got this for my kindle fire HD after I downloaded it I went into the kitchen it said there were ghost right next to me ,  the words didn't add up the only thing that added up was it said Rome the grassAfter that I was scared to go to bed,",5
"I got this game a few weeks after I saw the Conjuring. I didn't believe that spirit stuff could be THAT crazy or dramatic. Some kids at my middle school believe I'm psychic. I sometimes see things, I sometimes hear things, and when I wake up in the morning after a dreamless sleep, I have (a) scratch(es). I'm not sure if I'm going then myself or there is some sort of spirit who likes or hates me. I've watched Celebrity Ghost Stories in the past but I stopped when I entered 5th grade two years ago. Now, as a seventh grader, I'm not interested in this stuff anymore. I got this app to see how fake it was. Our parents were asleep so we (my sister and I) thought that was close to&quot;alone&quot; so I turned this on. We have had many pets before. They all died except one that I set free. When I started my homework, I saw a blue dot kind of behind-ish and right-ish. I looked at where you see communication and it said. I said hi and how are you. I said if you want me to turn it off to not die yourself. Nothing appeared so I kept my saying and came into here. This is a great app.Ooh! Just now I realized a dog died next door. When I said &quot; Bailey&quot; two dots appeared. More coming soon!",5
I got this on my tablet and I went to the beach in florda.....ghosts were everywhere. So I hope it works on my kindle.,5
"I guess this works, I don't know.  It detected ghosts in my house which is impossible seeing as we built it a little over 20 years ago and nobody has died there.",4
I haven't caught any so called &quot;ghosts&quot;yet but I think this app is pretty crappy SORRY!!!!!!!I just don't like apps that might scare the macaroni out of people!,2
i haven't tried this yet. is it a fun game and as well as a creaky app? it looks freaky!!,3
"I immediately turned on this app once I downloaded it. I believe in spirits. Plus... STOP CALLING THEM GHOSTS! I don't know why, but I feel like I'm disrespecting them when I call them ghosts. So I call them spirits. Anyway...A red dot showed up at the very top of the screen. It looked like it was pointing at the house across our street. Then, it said &quot;MARK&quot;. That freaked me out, because a few years ago, a guy named Mark used to live in that house.",5
I just downloaded that app and al itvdid was keep going in circlesthe reviews I read made the app believable but honesty its nit.what those other reviews are said.to be.,2
"I just downloaded this app, but I have not used it yet (it is 1:41 in the morning, I hope you see why not). My friend and I are interested in ghost stuff, so I am planning on bringing my kindle over next time we hang out :] . Whether it is real or not, it should be some fun!",5
"I just got this app and it's very interesting!The first word it told me was &quot;end&quot; and I happen to be watching the Syracuse/Rutgers basketball game and it had 2 seconds left on the game, coincidence, I don't know.I've always been on the fence about ghosts, not sure if they exist or not.Fun entertaining app!",4
I just got this it is just for entertainment mine said &quot;Began and Fighting&quot; But its not real people don't think its real,4
I kinda like it.  It is very interesting and the comments it makes are on the mark most of the time.,3
I know ghost aren't real but its good to scare little or older brothers it does ok trying to scare you PLEASE NOTE GHOST ARENT REAL DO NOT BELIEVE IN GHOST.HAVE FUN SCAREING OLDER OR LITTLE,4
I know there is a ghost that has followed me around for years. but it seems that there may be 2. always 2 dots that come and go. the only odd thing is one of the first spoken words was &quot;draw&quot; when there's a sketchpad at my feet... and also getjar has the full version for free currently :)),5
"I know this is just fun, but why does it give me the creeps when I have it on at night alone??? Still waiting for it to say a word that freaks me out!",4
"I'll give it props for being entertaining, and when I first used it, it freaked me out a little. I heard the words string, star, went, and mind. Not a lot happened so I guess my house just isn't haunted. Haha :)",3
I love this app it may not be real but it's fun  I have never had words line up to make a sentence but I love using it,5
I love this app its so fun. I got it and had found two ghosts. I told my cousin I got it she found a ghost on the toilet it was on red it was so funny,5
I love this application.  Its very fun and creepy to play with.  I do believe in spirits and possibility for them to interact through this. &#9733;&#9734;&#9733;,5
"I love this app. Me and my Nana play around with it a lot, and we both believe in ghost/spirits. One time my Nana was cleaning the house, and I turn this app on while she was vacuuming. Then a red dot appeared and the word &quot;Attempt&quot; popped up. A second later the word &quot;organization&quot; appeared. I thought about my Nana cleaning the house and that attempt organization means clean house. After that &quot;wherever&quot; popped up and I thought it was saying clean the house wherever it needs to be cleaned. I think this app is pretty cool!",5
"I luv it. its soo creepy. I was at a place for kids/teens to relax while their parents go do stuff and don't need you and me and my friends were doing this on our kindle fire,  and it said A LOT of stuff. it said hung tiny cowboy couch (while we were on the couch) and behind. it was more active by the bathroom. creepy l. the girls room. we all crunched in there and it said dance. so we were allvdancing in the bathroom. lol! then the person who &quot;watches&quot; us said one at a time. it was really funny. and at my house there are always two red or yellow or whatever (which are the ghosts. red is. closest to you and green is farthest) and they say one is a girl and the other is a boy. it said air. then I walked by my stairs and it said stairs. and once the closet door banged and it pretty much only talks when by it. too long sorry ik.",5
"I'm not sure if I believe in this stuff but it was very interesting. My daughter got the app and after listning to her storys I thought I would get it. There wasn't much activity when I turned it on until my Husband walked in the room then there were 2 red dots on the radar and the word ""Established"" came up. I had just gotten out of the shower, talking to my husband, naked I might add, and the word ""Beautiful"" came up. Now I could flatter myself and think it was talking about me but I just brushed it off then I had to give my husband Insulin, 2 shots which he doesn't like very well and was grumbly about it, when I was through I looked at my Kindle and another word popped up, ""Necessary"" Coincidence? I don't know but it is very entertaining and I would recommend it for entertainment purposes.",4
I'm scared. I was scanning my room &amp; it picked up the word 'pair' and right next to me were a pair of my favorite voodoo dolls &deg;^&deg;,4
"I'm very familiar with ghost-hunting equipment and EMF and EVP theories related to ghosts.  Whether if this app &#34;works&#34; or not, it is entertaining and surprizing with the words it picks up.  Recently this app was a huge hit at a party I attended...everyone downloaded it to see what the spirits would say at the guest's house and then to use it at their own homes.  Alot of fun!",5
I opened it up and I got a signal and eventually when it moved closer it said nearer . and for all you curious. people it doesn't say the word it just puts it on the screen under the title,5
"I read the other reviews and it was scathe when I was walking with this app on it said muscle,church, and other stuff I do not rember when I am alone the ghosts come sometimes but when my brother comes they leave and when my brother turned the volume on and the ghost said something I got freaked out because I wasn't ready so I turn the volume off when I go on this.",5
"I really want to be more skeptical of this app. But I've removed the variables it measures on some things it detects... and I can't explain wtf, just happened. If its a subject that intrigues you. I really recommend this app (I ended up upgrading to the paid app). For entertainment only, it can be a blast.",5
I recently acquired some belongings of a world war II fighter pilot and stored them in my basement. since then I have noticed odd things happening down there. I decided to test this. for two nights I launched the app in different areas of the house. nothing happened. I then took it downstairs and launched near the pilots belongings. I got a green dot and the word massage came up. I looked down and my cat was at my feet. my mother then told me to come upstairs but I didn't want to. the green dot turned red and the word torn appeared. FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!,5
i saw 2 words shadow and roman then i knew it was my great grangfather he died when i was 2 and he died and that night i saw his shadow omg!!!!!!!after i saw this i didnt go into my room for4 hrs.,5
"I stumbled upon this app and I just had to try it! I'm like obsessed with these ghost paranormal things! I got it and after two days I got it these words popped up on the screen like, &quot;these&quot; &quot;leaf&quot; &quot;happened&quot; and &quot;vapor&quot; I was not sure what it meant cuz it didn't make sense and after the word vapor appeared I heard this loud crash from my storm door!  CREEPY!  If u r really interested in paranormal stuff like me u should TOTALLY get this app!",5
It actually works!! So I have a dog and he always barks at nothing. I believe ghosts though and so does my friend. We think its a ghost he's barking at. So I took this app one time he was barking and nothing was there but the radar said friend and dog with a red dot and it was on low too!,5
It detects that there is ghosts around me. I did not move because I was scared. That did a good job of scaring me before going to bed.,5
It freaked me out when I bought it. I thought green and red dots were something eles... What are they anyway. After that my heart start racing... looking around I tried to not think of it. Someone tell me what's going on?! Freaking Scared!!!,4
I think I would enjoy this app more if my house was haunted. Very rarely does anything come up on the radar and not too many words are said. It's still fun though!,3
"I think that its probly fake, I mean some peeps could be lying. you really never know the truth, and I cant find that out! especially becouse it isn't installing on my kindall fire! whitch kinds sucks, I do know that people say they get in fights and then that person dies, but its just a app. I guess you never know the truth!! paranormal!!!!:) :(",1
I think the app is fake cuz I saw dots then they disappeared. Unless ghosts somehow escape detection the app is fake. 3 stars cuz I don't wanna give a bad review in case it is real,3
"I think this app is so kewl. My house isn't (well to me) hunted it keeps putting out words that I guess mean something to me but the first word that it said was ice and I was by my freezer, and it also said Sam, chair like six times, and some other word that didn't rlly mean anything to me. But I still think this app is kewl.",5
I think this game sucks so don't waste your time buying it.it said the word handle I'm like this is dumb. scary but dumb,1
I think this is so cool people say my school is hunted so I'm going to go arround the so called hunted auditorium and see if it delly is or if they are just trying to scare me Wish me luck!,5
"I thought that it really worked, but  I speak Spanish so my kindle language is Spanish , I started to run the app and it showed some words in Spanish, I thought &quot; oh the app is on English-language but it shows Spanish words, it works&quot; , but then I changes the language of the kindle to English and rebooted the kindle, what happened? Now it shows only words in English. Do I have multilingual ghosts in my apartment? I don't think so, however it's a good app",3
it is cool but not real but it is weird bcuz I picked up my bag and it said the word bag. and my dad was making dinner in the kitchen and it said the word kitchen. we have a lot of ghosts in our house. you should try it at least it free,3
It is very scary to find out that ghosts are around you but this app does not work and it does not detect anything. Atleast in my house it didn't.,2
I tried it in my grandmothers house and it said 'simple' I was like What the heck.BUT its cool and that's fine with me..,4
It's a fake. Me and a buddy had the same thing and we were right next to each other but it didn't have the same stuff. Sorry to you believers.,4
"it said all these words Germany, along, pink, encrease,we're, yours, identity,owner,double,Virgina,about,fat,dug,found,plate.  its very cool I would try it if I were u",4
"it said &quot;parents&quot; &quot; birth&quot; &quot;accident&quot;. I am an only child! my mom is not pregers!p.s. I know ,s go in between words, and .s go inside of &quot;s!",1
its alright..maybe. fun prank for sleep oversea but when it &quot;picks up&quot; something..it says ramndom words likemilk &amp;guide...like what does that even mean??,2
it's an alright app because I lived in the same apartment for about six years now and if you stay up by yourself you'll get scared for hearing footsteps and voices so this some what helps,5
"its a pretty cool app...but since I live in Italy, there cant.be American.ghosts right? so imbpretty sure its not true.... but the thing really shocked me is that: my sis Samantha was taking a shower, and the ghost thing said &quot;Samantha, shower&quot; is that weird or what?!",4
"it scared the living daylight's out of.me when blue dots appeared dissapeared appeared. I am superstitious.  and I'm afraid of this kind of stuff. but if u r like me get it and b wit a friend when u do this. DONT B ALONE OR ULL BE LIKE ME!!! I fell off my bed and ran into the living room, looked at my mom looked at me and went back to bed. I immedialy turned off my kindle and fell asleep. I had a dream of a ghost! AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! but I liv it.",5
"its cool but honestly I think that it is stupid. It's one of those games you have to be drop dead bored to want to playinteresting..... but, stupid",2
"Its fun to play around with it, getting random words that normally relate to something but what time is there when a word wont relate, I think its fake but its still fun to mess around with.",5
its like going in circles but tugs all it does so its kinds boron but I'll.wait till it does smth in spooky!!!!peace,3
Its okay sometimes its interesting but most time doesn't do anything to raise a eyebrow..every once in awhile you will pick something up but only entertaining when shows words not just the dots!,2
it told me to stop breathing...I'm not lieing.... this app is scary but so KOOL...ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!!!!!!!it hurts!!!!!!!,5
"It was a fun little app for a few hours. After a while, the ghosts would show up in the same spot on the radar no matter where I was eventually, so it became boring. Either the ghosts just like to follow me on my right side, or the app stopped creating random blips and got stuck in the same postition. lol Like I said, it was fun for a short time. Uninstalled it now.",3
it was really cool but too creepy. I think my house is hunted so I got it and it was way to creepy I can't sleep now,5
it was weird I just opened it and all it said was Mary. that's it. the only Mary I know is my great grandma who is doing fine. after that some red dots appeared and left. if anything it gets you thinking. overall an interesting app. if you like a little superstition I recomend it!,3
"It works, its free. C'mon guys, get the darn thing already. Ive had some creep outs and some laughs from this thing.",5
"it works. just give it time and a green,yellow,or red dot will appear(I don't know what they mean.) I would recommend this app to people who don't think this app works; I challenge you:)",5
it works. my house has been makeing weird noises and what not and the weird part is that there r three kids in the house my older brother born in march and it said march and showed one ghost and I'm born in June I'm the second oldest and it said June and showed two and my little brother was born in December and it said December then it also said men toinght and shoulder and i felt something on my shoulder so crazy and true,5
it works real it said sink and our sink was full then it said mother reader and my moms a big reader then my step dad said are you a him or her and it said him then we sat on our couch that a sectional and it said sectional and after and we got our sectional after we moved in to our house,5
"I was a spectic at first when me and my bro had the same app and we picked up different readings but... when we were in a car it didn't pick things up for hours, if this was a funny joke app I wouldn't wait 1 hour waiting for a reading",4
I was at a family renunion then when I opened the app and saw at least 14 ghosts all around me,5
I was at my cousins house for his birthday and there were too ghosts behind him it was creepy. Another one was at my house and the top of the screen have daughter it was terrifying. I do believe in ghost because my old house was haunted. Get this app even if you don't believe in ghost.,5
"I was at walmart buyin me some shoes, and it said &quot;lady&quot; and about 10 seconds later a female worker came and asked if I needed help with anything, really weird",5
"I was bored and turned it on and I am a, child I texted my friend and said it is bullcrud and then it said well well well child and two ! Dots appeared and then  disappeared  and got closer now I am nauseous",5
"I was going to use this app to find me some ghosts, but then the similarly legit Scanner Emotion app told me I wasn't in the mood. :(",3
"I was holding it in my room. it showed 2 spots of activity. I sat on my bed and picked up a photo of my boyfriend in a metal frame, andirons immadiatly said metal, and then, 2 seconds later, frame. not sure if its real or not, but it really freaked me out!!!!",5
I was in my brothers room playing with my kitten.then it said wet.my kitten went to the litter box and went pee then jumped on me and she had wet feet. funny thing I pointted it to my brother and it said....... OLD. hahaaaaaaaa. it is a great app.,5
"I was in my livingroom doing this app and it started listing instruments that I played. such as piano. then right where the piano was, it says musical and book. I was so scared!!!!!! the app is very accurate and I totally recommend it.",5
"I was laying on my bed testing this app  when I farted. then, on the screen the word &quot;wet&quot; popped up and I started laughing histerically.",5
i was sitting down messing around with my kindle when i decide to open this app up. i was looking at it and it said a ghost  was in my brother room. i walked in and it was only my cat in there. i started petting her then a red blip appeared right were my cat was at the same moment a word appeared at the top of the screen. it said &quot;don't/stop/enjoy,5
I was told it was pretty cool.....I found it to be pretty lame.Not a fan and I will probably delete it.,2
I was using this app and it said family and then my whole family lifted off of the ground and floated away. I hope they come back because I am getting kinda lonely but this app really works!!! This was proof!,5
"I work with spiritual investigations and am still on the fence as to whether this program really works. I've had no &#34;words&#34; that have meant anything to me, and at times it sits foreve and displays nothing...but maybe I'm in a ghost free zone :o) Not sure how it is supposed to detect ghosts...but it's a fun conversation piece with others.",3
I would say that this app is the real thing. it showed me that there was a ghost was by me and said &quot;orange &quot; and I was wareing orange cloths.  this app is adiquit and I would recsmend it if you want to talk to your ghost.,5
Me and my cosine have been tracking this and one word said green and I was useing a green pencil or when we were in the hall playing a board game it said hall.Weird!:0,5
me and my friend were playing with this and all these dots were popping up on the screen with words like DIE and HELLO CHILDREN.,4
me and my little sis just got this app and its kinda creepy. the first word was western and we live in Indiana and it doesn't make sense. the second word was Bush and our uncle is outside now gardening. the third word was forgotten and i don't think i forgot anything. oh well. this is a pretty good app to freak out your friends as long as you don't believe. i dont but i still think its creepy.,3
middle of the night and turned it on and we were scared because it said &quot;I don't like you Nicole &quot;and it said my name so Im freaked out,5
"My 4yr old daughter insists there's a ghost in her room that usually manifests itself either shortly before or after bedtime. I downloaded this to prove there was nothing to be afraid of and took it in her room. Of course nothing was there, so thanks Ghost Radar! Now if you can get busy on a &quot;Monster Radar&quot; app, that would be awesome!",5
my cousin has a ghost detector. when my ghosts show up her's goes off like mine. even though she doesn't believe i do. ugg. i'm sure that ppl like me know and feel a ghost's presence. i asked ghosts questions and they answered me. my cousin thinks that's just a coincidence. i don't. download this app and i guarantee if you believe in ghosts this app will work great,5
My daughter and I have played with this ever since I got it. It's on numerous electronic devices in my house. Fun!,5
My daughter wanted to see if this app was good and she thinks it useless I don't know if I'd recommend it,3
"My friend Jackie and me had a fight at her house, and she got killed shortly after (:'(). So when I went to her room (the room she got killed in) to clean up, I ran the app and immediately it picked up 'sorry'!!! OHMYGOD!!!!!",5
my friends found 50 ghosts in one 1 day and it was true and it was so scary and we heard noises when everyone was asleep. Im not joking you can come over and see for your self,5
My house is haunted and i used this in my room it said. Several  Enjoy and i talked to several friends and enjoyed the day.Some people said it did not worn then your house is not haunted if anything get this,5
"my kds love this. if you are under ten then you will enjoy it. kept them occupied for many nights, and left thwemalittle scared!",4
"My little brother was playing with his Lego and the radar kept dectecting things toward.him, it said on my screen that horse thing I looked he was playing with a horse Lego!! This is truly a fun app :)",5
My poppy is gone! I new it talked so when I was at the air part it said &quot;flight&quot;I jumped up and screamed then I heard the announcer said taking flight,5
my sister got this on her kindle fire and in yellow letter ant the bottom of the screen printing her name.that happened when a ghost appeared on the screenthis app is totally spooky,5
My sister put this on my new smart phone as a joke. &#34;Joke&#34; being the operative word. We had a couple of light laughs. Not sure I will keep it.,3
Not exactly what I wanted.  Looking for something to have fun with Grandkids.  Just a low tech toy for kids.,1
"Not for serious ghost hunters, but it is a cool little app for kids to have fun with. Plain, simple app to pass the time for a bored child",3
not the BEST app in the world because it said salmon now and banana when I was eating one!!! omg get this app!!!,4
oh my God I was reading these comments and shaking my butt off and I turned on radar and it said shaking it also I asked my mom for a bowl and it said bowl never been so scared,5
OH MY GOD THIS WORKS ALL RIGHT! IT SAID CAMP AND I AM GOING TO CAMP AT BRADFORD WOODS FOR A SCHOOL FEILDTRIP! I hope it's not real I'm scared!,5
"oh wow weird!  the first night i installed it and let it run. 3 things happened in less than a few hours.  one, it said &quot;john&quot; ...my name is jon! then it said &quot;jonathon&quot; creepy! then i let my dog out side...i let her out for a few minutes, came back and sat, then let her back in...came back to the phone and it said the word &quot;porch&quot;...right when my dog was out side waiting for me at the back door!  then tonight, i had to write this review...i was out eating with my partner, and we left about 11:00 pm...at 11:03 it said &quot;transportation&quot; weird weird weird!  lots of other weird words show up, many of them were just plain weird to be a coinsidance! check this app out! you'll get hours of enjoyment! trust me!",4
"Okay nothing spooky or out of the ordinary for me. I am by no means a skeptic. I have gotten blue red and the yellow spots, and a few words that did not seem to relate to anything at all, but hey I may just be in a ghost free area....",1
"ok here's what happenedwhen I opened it for the first time, I was watching a show about a pawn shop. then, it said shop. I have a kindle fire. it doesn't have a camera or recording system. O-O",5
ok I truer this out the first time then all of a sudden I hear a wires noisiest and on the radder there was a... GHOST to me that's a little creppy but the bad part is I cant rember the words that come up u might not beloved me but I beloved in ghost so don't ruin it 4 me by saying they army real. If u need me il be looking 4 ghosts. CREPPY,5
ok i was sitting on my bed and two yellow dots came up on the radar. then it said monkey.....i don't understand?? i don't have a monkey or have any thing to do with one not even stuffed animals. oh well i guess i can creep my friends out the next time i have a sleep over. :),4
ok so I just got this app ive deleted it a few times cause I thought it was dumb but then I was in my room and it was facing my mirror and it said glass then it said stronger and stronger is the name of one of my books! get the app its awesome!,5
Ok so me and my cousins hunt ghosts. We think their condo is haunted. We see figures an get weird feelings. We want to know if it's true or not. I haven't tried it there yet but we think it might work. So we r still hoping.,4
"Ok so my friends house she thinks it's haunted so we took my kindle there and so many ghosts came up!!! We where terrified!!!!  But I don't get what red,blue,yellow,or green means?  I wish it would tell u!  But this is an awesome app and my house is like not full of ghosts but ya.  Talk to u later. :)  :) :)Have fun finding out your house is........HAUNTED!!!!!!",4
"Ok, so my friend was visiting the other day...she's British.I held up my kindle with the ghost radar running and I'm not pulling anyone's leg, it said 'British', and we held it up to my cousin, who's very tall and very athletic and it said 'sport'. then 2 days ago, I put on my living room floor (it seems to really like my living room) and it said 'dog', my dog was sleeping just a couple feet away. And sometimes it'll say random things like 'kite' and 'child' when neither of those things are around. so I'm skeptical as to whether or not this is real or for just entertainment purposes...nonetheless, it's creepy when it's accurate.",3
ok so only reason I put this on a four cause it scared the beejeebers out of me!!  I had it on for first time and pointed at my dad and he looooves fruit so he was eating oranges and the word that came up was fruit!! solo weird!,4
OMG a red dot appeared behind me then I got a chill on the back of my neck in that spot,5
OMG! I am so freaked out it said that some ghosts in my OWN HOUSE were saying &quot;blew&quot;. That is so freaky. IS THIS REAL!PLEASE TELL ME.!Oh my goodness.,1
"omg this app freacked me out i was in a hotel room with my mommy and the thing seid : burn,hurt,nacked,and murders ?? that night ( we where in florida)  so like,  then to hours later the hotel burnt down!!! omg!!!! then a deleted the app.Befor i deleted it i had a couple more weird things happen one more was when i was in my room and i decided to open the app thincking it was a fool kind of stupid app.  ( its not) . but i was in my bed and it seid : lexi my sister thats her name so the next dat she was in the hospital with stiches!!! CREEPY CREEPY CREEPY! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"omg, this thing is sooooo cool, it actually detects electromagnetic waves, i turned on my Tv, and there was a signal. if you want to sees ghosts, this is for really yall!",5
omg this thing kreeps  me out but it said all what the heck was that supposed to mean this is the craziest thing I have ever downloaded in my life before it is so so ffffrrrreeeeaaaakkkkkyyyyy!!!!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!!!!!&iexcl;!!!&iexcl;,5
o my gosh this scared the living he*l out of me when i first turned it on it said &quot;devil&quot; it scared me cause it kept getting closer ill put it on one more time and see me get more scared!!!!!!!,5
once I blew a airhorn and it said &quot;again&quot; so I did then I said to my cousin we should fight to see if there is a reasponse and it said &quot;don't&quot; creepy right I think it is real,5
One creepy thing is the first time I got it I tried it and it said that my cousin is a ghost!,5
"one of the first words I herd was protection. so does this mean that its my gardian angel. but I also got help, taken, and stranger so I think there is more than one. plus it showed I had 3 in my living room. idk if I should be scared or not.",5
(owners son) It's a fun app but I don't like how it blurts out random stuff. I was pretending to hunt ghosts when it randomly said &quot;potatoes&quot; that was a big cuincedence concidering that I was next to a sack of them but then it only said things like &quot;eagle&quot; and &quot;cheese&quot; and I was in the living room. Fun app though. I like randomness.,4
"People who get this app need to understand that it's not meant yo be real. This app was made to creep people out, not detect paranormal activity.",4
Point it around the room and watch it pick out where a ghost may be.  Scares the kids every time,4
really creepy when I walk down my hallway I always feel a tingling thing on my back like a spider so I used this thing and told me their was a ghost right behind me! but I don't like the crappy voice,4
"Since he doesn't believe in ghosts, my son just uses it for fun.  Hasn't played with the app for a while.  It's a cute gimmick.",3
so fake no such thing as ghosts why would there  be ghosts in my moms house really fake fake fake.,2
So I GOT this app and it showed two dots and its saying words like fog slipped and attached can someone tell me what the red yellow and green dots mean,5
so I was talking and I said &quot;I wonder what China is like&quot; and it said China right when I was going to say it,4
so my cousin. got this app and it said tales when my cousin was talking about her fiction books and then it said sir spent when a couple days ago I. spent some money then it said Tim which Tim teebow was going to my church soon then it said Christmas creepy right,5
"that's the question. if you believe ghosts, goblins, spirits etc walk amongst us. then this app may assist you in convincing unbelievers  such as myself.if on the other hand you do not harbor any curiosity towards &quot;life&quot; beyond this waking world, you might be sorely proved correct by this apps lack of clear &amp; convincing evidence.",3
The app has scared me and made me laugh so many times. especially when it started going bonkers in my moms car. every word had something to do with our conversation. we eventually just had to include it. hahaha. the best part though is that when my mom told me I should get a pregnancy test the thing said EVIDENCE.  i never laughed harder in my life! x),5
the dial spins and announces random words that don't relate to each other or anything.is it supposed to be bits of ghost talk?,3
The first word it said was quarter and I had a quarter in my pocket than it said park and I just got back from a walk in the park!!,5
the fist 2 seconds I Tuesday it I picked up something and it worked I was looping on this dudes head.,5
The ghost only talks to me. When someone else comes into the room it was like it was never even there.,5
then I downloaded it I was so confused. it like did not work at all. IT DOES NOT WORK. all it did was go in circles and said like one word. very boring. I hate it. DOES NOT WORK!!!!!,1
"The radar shows up and dots come up to show there is ghosts there. After a couple ghosts appear, your kindle or phone will start to say words. The first word my kindle said was construction. Later that day, I saw on the news that someone died in a construction accident near my house that day!  AHHHHHHH!!!! IT WAS TOTALLY CREEPY!!!!! If get creeped out easily don't get this app if you don't get creeped out you'll still get scared! BEWARE!!!",4
"the second night I got it, I was in my room talking to a spirit and I think he or she might have died in a war. I live on a military base, which would support why I say this: the words were sad, brave, run, edge, and blew. I think he or she was running from an explosion and stop on the edge of a cliff or something and was blown up. I am a daughter of a military father and I feel sorrow for him and my family. in case you ask about my name, my dad put me under his email. Salute our soldiers!!!",5
"They say it can be fooled by electronics, but I tested it out with my dsi when it was on and it picked up nothing",5
This app has got me thinking that my house is really haunted! But I'm not sure if I believe that this app works but I think it does. I will be carrying this all around my house and on every floor the little red dots show up. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4
this app is awesome. but I gotta say its creepy too. I just love this.appso get this.app you gotten this.already so.don't read do it,5
this app is awesome when i layer down blue and green dots showed up sooooooo creepy they said done both of them CREEEEEEPPPPPPPPYYYYYYYYY,5
This app is cool to scare my little brothers and sisters to thinking that there are ghosts. These words on the top of the app even sometimes give me a scare...,5
"this app is creepy but so true. me and three friends were outside the app showed red right on one of friends and he fainted,then got up and was acting creepy.",5
"This app is entertaining when I am relating, I do wish I could find an app that is more interactive. I do believe in spirits and would like to communicate with them.",4
"This app is freaky. The first time I tried, it said rain. I'm not so sure if this is accurate.",3
"this app is great for entertainment purposes, but is not to be taken seriously in my opinion. and like others said,it does ask for a LOT of personal info which I would not advise to give.",2
this app is great it makes everything more spooky now that I know there are a few ghosts in the attic.,5
This app is neat. Its funny to think if there are really ghosts among  us. This app is great. It is a lot of fun.,5
this app is pretty good. it freaked me and my sister out. there were red ghosts in my room and rite behind me. I was creeper out. one time I clicked on the app and rite away I saw ghosts in my bathroom. one time we heard a plastic bag move in my sisters room. we though it was a ghost so we said if there is a ghost in here show a dot in front of us on the radar. there was a red dot in front of us. we were scared. I do not think this app is any bogus but my mom does.,3
"This app is pretty weird. I was sitting in my living room and my brother was playing video games, and it said April. That's my brother's birth month. Then it said border when I was trying to extend the borders of my country in &quot;My Country&quot;. This app is awesome for me because I am a 100% ghost believer. I regimens to believers.",5
This app is real. Cause I have a fire place and it said fireplace. Then said orderAnd said would. C r e e p y.,5
this app is so cool it does work on kindle fire trust me I need more words so word word,5
"this app is SOO COOL!  lol I LOVE IT!  :DI would give this app 1,000,000,000 stars!  Kindle Fire users Get this app NOW!",5
"This app is stupid. It's goal is to freak you out. Ghosts are not even real. Spirits are real though. This app is a prank app. I saw the words that the ghosts were supposedly saying the words were tent, build, and remarkable. Don't buy this app.",1
"this app saved my life!  I was in an old building, and this radar said a vengful ghost was coming for me. I jumped out of the way, and the chair that I was just sitting in fell through the floor and down 16 stories l. THANK U GHOST RADAR!!!!!",5
"This app works great on my Kindle Fire. The first time I launched it me and my little brother were in our Tv room/ living room, and the words apperared in this order: live, area. Creepy! Also I was in my parents room and my dads name is Tom. The next thing I know the word appeared as &quot;Tom&quot; I recommend it!",5
"This device is not the real thing.  The words that it says are completely random; ask it a questions and you will get something illogical.  The &#34;spirits&#34; keep popping in and out, and sometimes it will say a word when it shows no spirits are around.  Fun for entertainment, but don't expect to use it on any ghosts hunts.",3
"this game is awesome. I rate it five stars because it is entertaining and fundimental. I have never written a review, but I felt the need to write one for this app",5
This game is no fun it is all fake. No fun at all. Says the same words over and over again. The real one is true talking one,2
"This game is not great fun like the old fashion quija board, or anything, but it is mildly amusing. The radar just rotates around a central point and small dots, presumably ghosts, appear on the screen.",3
this game is so stupid it doesn't even tel u wat to do I don't get it all it is is a bug circle that just spins and a dot shows up apparently that is the ghost and u have ti tap it apparently that gets rid of the ghosts,1
this is a skary game but its fun my brother loves this game.if it finished the sentences it would be much better I still give it a 5 star,5
this is freaky. the voice that tell you where the ghosts are is freaky and kids..... don't use this in the dark. over all I really like this game.... besides. the fact that it scared me a few times,5
this is one of my favorite apps to use. I enjoy using it around my house even if some people don't believe that it works I think it does. Great app,5
"This is really nice! :)) Me and.my family were in the living room...my dad.on his laptop, my sister playing around and watching the movie at the same time, my mom watching the movie too, while me... I was searching for apps as usual. it was 5:50 so it was kinda dark outside and the lights were off inside in our living room si ot looks nicer watching. I just got this app and when I opened ot one word came up and said darkness! :))) A must-have!! :))))",5
"this is really scary. it gave me the chills, it kept repeating house blood. but when i left my house it said come back. realllly creappyy",4
this is really weird i know its probably fake but i was watching Tv and was about to play mw3 so i pick up the controller then it said gun i was like whoa then 5 seconds later a commercial came on with a gun,5
this is so real l caught a ghost in the park and I freak out if I see another one I am going to screem my lungs out.,5
This is so scary I have a great grandma who died 2 years ago EXACTLY and her name was Emily. Who died at 82 years old and it said Emily 84!!! I love looking for ghosts!!!!!! This is great you gotta grt it.  =-O  scary,5
this is the best game in the world I mean it is so cool so I hope you can find some gost,5
this is weird cause  my mom was on her phone my bro was on the computer and my tv was going and it didn't pick up anything and they were all by each other so it should put off a strong signal but it didn't so that's weird the. first time I turned it on it was picking up strange moving signals and it said stuff like cow and none and other stuff and the second time it didn't  pick up anything up so the gohsts escaped without letting me know. (FREAKY)letting me know freaky.,5
"This really creeped me out. I heard noises, then it would get a reading. It said things like, wait, thing, and except. Really fun, if you like being creeped out. Oh, and my grandpa just died, so it makes it even creepier.",5
This really works .I was at my cousins house yesterday and it was going crazy.my friend was sitting on the couch and a red dot appeared on the screen.,5
"This thing is awesome, I started to walk around my house, It said &quot;tobacco&quot;. My dad sucks on tobacco, I said &quot;hey that's what my dad does&quot; and when I said that it popped up &quot;replied&quot;, spooky!!!!!",4
"Today I was in the hallway and I had this app on and it said principal, and sure enough my principal was coming down the hall towards me",5
"ummmmm.......... this app i relly creepy but it works i gess it said, given older blankets for with who reconise tim so i dont know a tim but i dont think this is something for young kids this mighr creep them out im 12 and yeah",2
"usaully I'm very paranoid and very suspicious so getting this app wasn't. the brightest idea. .. . however it was interesting to see how many ghosts were at my local arby's!  however it was very creepy when i was twirling my hair and it said, &quot;soft&quot;",5
Waste of my time.  I know it was just for fun but I didn't have any using this app. Took long time to down load,1
"Well, even if this is fake, it's fun. It kept me staring at the screen and wondering when I'll see another ghostie or hear something. I've seen several different types of ghosties and heard 'ancient', 'through', 'he'd' and 'syllable'. But seriously people, do you expect to get a free ghost finder thingy? Don't get mad if it doesn't work like you want it to and carry on a conversation with you.",4
"Well I looked at all the reviews, and it came out pretty interesting. Of course, this app probably deserves a few more 5 star reviews considering that some kids thought it was a game. Its pretty cool, freaky, and sent chills up my spine. As people offered me to go walk, I declined. I then turned on the radar, and caught 2 words: didn't, walk. Creepy, but extremely interesting. Probably useful for freaking out friends, family, or little kids.",5
"What a stupid game. My kid seems to like it but it has ended up prompting her to ask me all sorts of unaswerable questions about death so that's great. The part where it spews gibberish is pretty annoying especially. What does this mean mum? Nothing love, nothing. Argh.",2
what does the yellow meek what does the red meek I do not get it cool app thow the app is pritty cool for me I do mot get it at all,2
"when I am on this app no words pop up,and barely any dots.but once,a dot popped up where there is a picture of my great grandmother who died",3
"When I first started using it, I was sceptical. One of the first words was &quot; Chicago &quot;, then &quot;James&quot;, and factory. My Dad, James, lived in Chicago and welded in a factory. One night, my son called me to come and pick him up. This was unexpected. When I got back home, I turned it on. The words were, son, telephone, pick up. Now, you tell me!",5
When I first turned it on I got nothing :(  but the next night after I got my daughter to bed I had to run to the store. As I pulled out my keys to lock the screen door (its metal so it was kinda loud) it says &quot;softly&quot;! its done a few others as well. weather it works or not is for each person to decide but it has surprised/creeper me out a few times.,4
"when I first used this app I heard Atlantic and five minutes later I find out that I'm right next to the border of the Atlantic and these past couple minutes ive heard &quot; Kepler composed John experienced cheif gentle Norway character local crew burn front its face. And right after that I got Greek breeze keep lying position develop shouting parrelel, all In at least thirty minutes or less.this app works or not but it will freak you out if you let it or unless it says background knowledge about you.",5
when I got this app I thought it was cheap. where my family lives it used to be train tracks.... and while I was in the kitchen had two dots one was red and the other was blue ... I knew the red was me but the blue was in my garden where the train tracks were.this app tells the truth a ghost has been haunting me ever since I moved to this house . about when I was 6 a ghost was behind me and it felt like a gun was to my back..... I was fully awake!,4
"When I got this app, I thought it would be fun for me and my brother. But istead, it gave me the creeps. I first thought my house was raided by ghosts. D: I felt like moving out at first. So be careful when playing this app!",3
"When I was in my room I had my kindle turned on to this app.It kept saying stuff that didn't make sense but after an hour when it started getting dark out,there was at least six red dots on my screen,they were all around the screen but one did not move.I looked on the screen I thought it was actually really close to where I was sitting,it then said shoulder.I got a little freaked.I also asked some questions about back then when JFK was around and I said I bet he was a great president,it said agreed,I know what happend to the people in the house it was in the 60s they were around so I suggest if you know when the people lived in that house ask it questions when they were around,it really does work trust me.",5
"Whether or not you believe, this app will DEFINITELY make you question the possibilities! Eerily relevant responses from &quot;the unseen realm&quot;! Seriously, though, I bought this as a lark, expecting very little. However, within minutes of starting the radar, I was quite unnerved by some of the words coming through.Also, I know plenty of Kindle Fire users are complaining about not having a microphone to pick up voices, but I find that to be a benefit, as the app can't confuse random surrounding sounds as possible voices. O simply explain out loud that any entity that wishes to communicate can simply use the Kindle to speak to me. I have had very impressive sessions with different people, and different locations, each situation having different interactions, and outcomes.Just give it a fair try, and I promise you shouldn't be disappointed.",5
"While I do enjoy the Horror Genre, I do also have an interest in the paranormal.  So I figured, let me get this little novelty item for my kindle. It's kind of freaky to use late at night.  Although I won't go so far as to say it's real.  But if you want a little freaky app to kind of get you mildly jumpy/scared at night, here it is",3
"While I do not believe in ghosts, I do believe this app is picking up something in the surrounding areas, and yes, it is entertaining to think there is &#34;something there.&#34;",5
While I have yet to get an answer to a question it does give you responses and some of them are the oddest words. The word bank must be huge. I have kept it for fun and have even put it on my android. I have had both on together but not picked up the same thing in the same place or gotten the same word on both in fact I have not heard the same word twice on one device or any of the three together (wife's android). So i feel that a random generator/selector is not part of the program since most of those things &#34;pick&#34;  the same word from time to time. just try it what can it hurt?!?,4
within the first two seconds of use I picked something up. idk what it said but I was looping at the time. poop is yummy,3
wont install on my kindle fire.... can anyone help? I don't know if its all devices or just mine but it wont install. looks fun though.,3
"Wow&#8230;&#8230;great app.  Not sure how and why it works but it is DOING SOMETHING while it is on.  Call it bunk if you want but it operates differently in different buildings, same day.",5
you really think this is just a toy but you may really have a ghost in your house this app might not detect it but other things will lead to a ghost but its up to you to beileve,3
"Ads are just annoying and there really should be another way for advertisers to reach us - just not on the app itself. That having been said, go download one of the other versions of this app. It's a lot of fun to prove or disprove your results. Just let the ghosts explain themselves; don't read into what's happening. Enjoy!",2
". . . and I wish you stupid living people would stop trying to contact us. Do you realize how annoying you are? Now knock it off.By the way, this app simply lists words at random from the internal dictionary. If you think that it's somehow significant that 1 out of every 100 applies to your current situation than you're even stupider than I thought.",2
at first I was begging my dad for this app and when he finnally said yes I got it and it didn't even tell me which way to go to get it it ducks I hare it I cant beleive I wasted my time on this app,1
"...but after playing with it several times my opinion is that the app is silly, pointless, and not very much fun.",2
"Doesn't tell you how it works.  I only bought it because it was free, wouldn't have paid for it any other way.There's really no point to it",1
"First off, i apologize for offending anyone who believes in ghosts. But this app most likely has predetermined dots and words that just pop up at any time. I mean don't get me wrong this is a neat little app, but just think about it... your device has sensors that pick up &quot;ghost&quot; signals? No! Sorry but that's not it. Maybe its just me not fully believing but that's my way of thinking. Other than all that believe what you want!!",3
fun for 1secs but it is stupid says I have 6 ghost at a time 0_o don't get I need words s s s,1
Ghosts don't really pop up on my screen that much. pretty boring if you ask me. And random words pop up on the screen that I can't put together! lol,3
good hidden object game. if you like hidden object games give it a try.  I'm addicted to them so I love it,5
"Got this app for fun just to mess around, it's fun to freak yourself out sometimes =)  sometimes you get answers back and can't sleep lol, but it's still fun =)",5
I do not no wat to beliv. is it good or not I'm going to wat to git it tal.me if it is good plus. my sis mite git it to soooooooo chud. I git it,1
"I don't honestly trust this but from the other ratings it looks interesting.  I do believe in spirits.  Having spoke to one and feeling the presence of a couple.  This is more like a game, glad it's free.",3
I downloaded this and it came up with things like 'AWESOME' '0KAY' and other no-nonsense words. deleted it as much time as it took to load.,1
i downloaded this because of the reveiws.. Alls it did was show me different floored dots. Its Free so i didn't loose anything.Not worth your time.,1
"I fricken don't even believe in ghosts!!! it is weird, creepy,sooooo dumb, and fricken stupid!!! if u got this app u r stupid!!!!  DONT GET IT!!!! JUST DONT!!! TRUST ME NOT THEM!!!!! DONT GET IT!!!!!",1
I GO TO THE CEMENTARY AND NO GHOSTSEVERYONE KNOWS GHOSTS ARE REALLY IN THE CEMENTARYFAKEST APP EVER DONT BUY IT,1
I got two words in a two hour time.nothing but two thumbs down. it offer a free upgrade which I didn't do. maybe I should.,1
"I Have A Bipolar Ghost In My House.Should I Worry For My Life? I'm Scared. Oh No! What's That In The Corner? According To The App, It's Just A Pancake. Whew! I Feel Better.",5
I have a kindle fire and it doesn't haves microphone.... it took forever to get &quot;duck&quot; from it and like a minute later my lil bro came in and threw a toy at me. couinsidence... my point is that a kindle.fire doesn't have a microphone and if it doesn't have that it cant pick up anything from a &quot;ghost&quot; I also live in an apartment.... Haha FAKE DONT BUY IT RIP OFF EVEN THOUGH ITS TOTALLY FREE ITS JUST GONNA TAKE YOUR APP SPACE UP DONT GET IT!!!!,1
"I heard from other reviews, and I agree with all of the people who rated 1 stars.  It was very confusing, and just not a good app.  Everything went wrong and was just really not understandable.",1
I plan to turn this on at my next family gathering and make folks pay for my premonitions. All these random words that pop up and spooky people will surly make me a millionaire over night.,5
I recently purchaced this app and it sucks. I don't even understand it. This is the worst app ever. I recommend that you shouldn't get this app.,1
"I saw &quot;ill have another on Tv &quot; went to do this on my kindle,  and it said &quot;horse! &quot;  weird dudes!",5
I think this app is great for parties birthdays or just a lazy day I think it is great for when you are bored it is. a great thing to do when need some thing to do it is spooky but fun,5
"I think this app is real because my kindle fire doesn't have a camera but there's been a few times ive been doing something and it tells me what I'm doing. its also said words like &quot;blood, cutting, aunt, present, complete, exercises, turn, sir&quot; et cetera.I LOVE IT. It gives me the thrill:)",5
I thought this would be a fun app for my grandchildren but it is actually so boring you'd have to be a ghost to have any patience with it.  Sometimes nothing happens for a very long time and then an arrow points to the supposed location of a ghost.  Uninstalled.,2
it is completely fake because i got it no ghosts no words just fake i cant believe i read all the reviews got it and nothing just BORING!!,1
it said there were 100 ghost in my house and my mom has lived in a haunted house before and this house is not haunted I wish u could do 1 star,1
it showed where one was i got up it didn't move toward me when i walked toward it and worst part is is this is a prank to scare a 5 year old worthless don't get it save your time and download something else.,1
"it's kind of boring. it just... well... does.... not much. when I first played it, it worked well, and I liked it. now, not so much. it gets really, and I mean really, boring after a while. I deleted it...",1
"It tells me that my dads couch spot is haunted. its worth it! I recommend this app to all ghost lovers and mystery lovers! scares you a little but is F-U-N-N-Y! I got a couple of words like; ' below' and 'someone'. When I saw 'below' I thought basement, which we always thought was haunted. When it said 'someone' I looked at the window and there was a wasp trying to get in.",5
It works. I saw some stuff on mine. One said STEM an  the other one said SALMON. Pretty creepy to right.,4
I was hoping to get a message from someone but this app gave my a bunch of rubbish-y answers.  I got &quot;circus&quot; &quot; topic&quot; &quot;news&quot; &quot;selection&quot; and &quot;joined&quot;. the last one only made sense because I walked past a locked gate at my neighbor's house. his dog Maggie died a few years ago but no mention of &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;Maggie&quot;.,1
Maybe it is unfamiliarity but I do not much like it even though it works. Perhaps if I use it more. I have no idea what I should be &#34;looking for&#34; so all I see is a radar-like screen with never a blip. And if I saw a blip I would not know how to understand it.,2
Remove app from Digital Order,5
"so I got this app today and have bin playing it on and off for about 2 or 3 hours I think that it is really a neat app but to be honest we just got our house built like 6 months ago and the chances that I have about 6 apperitions in our house is really slim. But I like to think that it may be a spirit attached to an antique that we may have. I honestly think that that would be really awesome but I'm not getting much clues because the only words I got where pink, shelf, automobile, soldier was a good one and my first one i also got fourth, fellow, and some other bland words.",5
"So, I let it run for 40mins and nothing at all happened. This is a waste of battery and space.Don't bother installing.",1
"so I'm untreated in this kind of stuff right right k so I was going to down loud it doesn't download at all on kindle fire so ya it may but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  don't get it please I don't u to not get what u want I splooooooooooooo sorry bye o ya if your cute call me",1
the app does not work at all.I really like ever thought it was going to work.don't get the app it does not work at all,1
"The app Ghost Radar was a complete waste.  Unless you are a real believer in ghosts, do not I REPEAT, do not download this app.  I was watching Star Trek and my Ghost Radar said &quot;CLOTHING&quot; which I thought was weird, and I saw nothing that resembled clothing.  Also, my battery got hot really fast.  I don't believe in ghost.  I just thought it would be funny and creepy.  Overall, do not download this app.",1
The greed gaympppruzas fire high huff getting yrs guiding yards yrs harder trends added through th uhh much Hirsch hubbub g th hugging. Hugger g th hugging g th uhh,4
The only thing haunting about this game is that no matter what I do I cant completely delete the stupid thing. I delete it off my saved list and it shows back up in a day. I delete from my kindle and it comes back every time I shut it down,1
There is no uninstall button for this app.  I neither use nor want this anymore.  How so I uninstall it???,3
this ap is a little creepy but there is no way this ap works. I stood right next to my dog and the scanner picked up a gost next to me and clearly my dog is not a gost.,1
this app is really really really weird. is it supposed to be real or for phranks? it blurts out stuff like &quot;Italy&quot; and &quot;shoelace&quot; and &quot;coming&quot; and its just really weird. I just don't get it.,2
this app is scary. ok so me and my friend were walking around the house and in one of the rooms it said laid.,3
This app is sloop cheap!  The green dots are usually nothing!  I mean seriously!  Its free People!  There is only two words that discribe this. CHEAP APP!!!!!!!!!,1
"This app is stupid, you stare at a circle and then it says some random words. That's all people! Come on, admit it, this app is stupid.",1
"This app looked fun but it didn't seem to do much of anything once I got it going. I may have been missing something, but I am an experienced geophysicist that uses very expensive electromagnetic instruments of various types on a regular basis.... anyway, I deleted it.",2
this app scared the crap out of my little sister even though I told her that its bull. I picked up like 5 ghosts. kinda creepy. apparently a ghost was on top of me and in the bathroom.  so whatever.. get it I dnt care.. and btw if a ghost app is free tht means its BULL CRAP. anyway enjoy if u do install this app. (u probably wont enjoy this)  :D,1
This app sucks monkey balls. It doesn't even work I tried it and it was nada. Defiantly not kindle fires. My friend Lavender says that she tried it with my kindle and it sucked. DONT BUY TURN BACK WIL YOU CAN!!!,1
this game is so stupid all it does is show u a bunch of lines. wow exciting! NOT!!!! it does not even show anything on the radar ever. truly suckish.,1
This is a good way 2 get u and ur friends freaked out at a late night birthday party .,3
this is an app to aquire your information for future use to steal from you be smart about things along this line.  if people wise up they may stop or be significantly slowed.,1
this is such a lame app. I mean really how is it even supposed to work. at school I saw one of my class mates playing with this app and it was stupid because I was thinking it doesn't even work. don't waste your time or space.,1
This so totally fake cause theres no such thing as ghost and if your scared don't be cause there's no such thing as ghost!,1
"Total waste of time!  Sure, I don't expect catching ghosts with it, but I'd expect some entertainment out of it. And with that mindset, I rate this app total crap! Hope I quit the app fast enough that it didn't con the advertiser in the ad banner!",1
WE ALL KNOW THIS DOSEN'T REALLY WORK DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. IT WILL JUST TELL LIES.DON'T GET IT MOSTLY IF YOU HAVE A KINDLE FIRE.,2
"Well, I wouldn't consider this a fake ....but the likely possibility is that they just have random dots appearing and design it like a real ghost radar and have random common words appearing. I just downloaded it and when I opened my app, it was like &quot;pot &quot; and on the right side of me there was a flower pot. I thought it was cool, but come on, there are pots everywhere! either in your yard or somewhere else, you can always find something common with the random word that appears on the radar. Its a cool app, but in my opinion, they just choose a buncha random words that make you think this app can &quot;detect &quot; stuff when your fooling yourself out. I was using it this morning on my bed and it was like &quot;can, winter, principal &quot;?! Wtf, am I in school or something? lol but this app is worth the download even though it might be fake.",3
"welllll ... on my kindle fire, ,,,,, it takes a while to turn difrent words BUT I was eating lime jellllo and it said ...... eat,lime,jello that freaked me out .... then it said fat.. and I was like oh no u didn't ghost ima  gona  get u ... btw I'm actually skinny .. so yeah that's my expierence.",4
wen I did it it said Dave I contenued it sed come here! (my name is Ethan)  sxvcvbx xfbgzfh xfhdzxvg cdsah Rees wesqase,5
"Wow. I just had this app on and went into my kitchen when it went haywire with words and letters and warnings. It had red, green, yellow, and strange blue dots all over the screen. It was awesome. I really recommend this app. It is lots of fun and I am glad I got it :)Note: Review is from my daughter.  Thus far it seems to do really well, saying ""Father"" when I am in the room, and saying, ""metal"" when her Mom is in the room.  Her Mom had a metal rod in her leg when she was younger and it still messes up antennae TV signals when she is near them.  Thus this is a more interesting version then older ones I have been exposed to &lt;--This last part is me.",5
"blahity boga blaa I don,t care I wan,t to waste time doing less important stuff but I like it its ok",1
"C'mon people, explain how an app can get connection with a ghost...? What? Does a ghost have a micro chip in its head? Explain that. Explain that. Then I'd maybe believe it. &gt;:/",1
"don't get its like a wigi board a portal from the spirit world the ghost(s) will follow you and the people you share this app with everywhere you go and haunt you and friends I have been seeing things and so have my friends. I've been seeing a blue orb, my friend is hearing foot steps outside her room when there's nobody outside her room and she's seeing a girl in the middle of the night, our other friend is seeing buses on a brick wall and a black mist, our other friend is seeing fugues, and our final friend is also seeing buses on the same brick wall. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!",1
I don't really believe in ghosts and I still don't but when I got this is spelled out the word poop......then I put the sound on and it said &quot;porn&quot; so yeah don't know what to say about that but you know it's fun to mess around with and its free so it's your choice if you wan to freak yourself out hope you enjoy :),3
i just love the fakeness. it just chooses random places and words to make you believe fake stuff. the five star reviews are fake,1
i know i should be kicked thinking this would work and this is just a game but nothing even showed up not even a word.,1
it said passage when I got close to a door. it says sell. then it said center! FAKE APP DONT GET IT EVER!!!!!!!,1
"Looks cool with all the lights and such but never tells you what you are seeing, how it is possibly picking things up...just an odd idea for an ereader or a phone.",1
might be worth having fun with on Halloween. c'mon I sure hope nobody takes this seriously. Just throws out random common words that anyone might relate to. Plain silly.,1
this does not work don't waste your time or your money on this app Don't get this app. not good,1
This is so stupid and such a waste of memory. It doesn't even work (although I figured it probably wouldn't).,1
wow is all i can say so fake it is so stupid dont waist your time. i deleted it after 5 mins,1
I didn't even get this app because I already know that ghost are NOT REAL!!!! I'm gonna say this one more time GET A LIFE!!!,1
the software doesn't have the ability to detect such things - the app preys on wishful thinking and the gullible. so have fun but don't expect something real or functional,1
this game is cool. it makes random noises and says random words that make it seem like there is a ghost near u. one time I think I ran one over.so fun . u should get if u haven't yet.,5
Unfortunately I haven't seen any interaction am I supposed to take my kindle case off??? I'm so confused lol  so I don't know if it works or not now -_-,2
A great &#34;toy&#34; I am not sold it can identify ghosts but it does keel me entertained when I have some down time,3
A kid I know loves it but I didn't. It's a rip off and I'm glad I deleted it. Yay.,2
app apears to randomly generate ghosts and does not detect magnetic fields. overall app is just a waste of time,2
Everyone that thinks the app is creepy should chill! Just think that the Lord is always by your side. So even if their some how is a ghost then you are safe!,2
Great to give the older kids a lil scare I couldn't hardly contain my laughter watching them get nervous. I don't recommend using this with the younger ones probley too much even though its just for fun.,4
"i am a believer in the paranormal. I can't say for certain that this actually works (i'm using the high-tech nexus7 tablet to use it) but it has had some strange coincedences and makes it very interesting to use, use in the dark to make it creepy.",4
I got this and it was just for fun. I tried it and at first no red dots. Then a red dot appeared. I was with my sis and so freaked out. All it said was V a million times in the corner. I was so freaked and deleted it. Now downloading it again,2
"I got this app for 2 reasons: it was free, and it looked cool. But it got annoying. All it was, really, was a green radar that showed little dots every so often. I quickly got bored with it and deleted it. Afterwards, I was persuaded to actually BUYING the other version of Ghost Radar, which was supposedly &quot;better.&quot; Sure, it was a little cooler. You could go back and forth from the classic radar and an activity waves line graph. It also &quot;translated the ghosts messages to you,&quot; which I actually believed for a while. But don't believe a word of it, people. The radar does not &quot;sense&quot; anything. If you want an app that you can just use for fun, go ahead. But it does NOT sense ghosts. Just saying whaylt your gut is screaming.",3
I got this app on tablet.and as soon as I turned it on it said fence.which I freaked at.because our backyard fence just got redone.which I had no pitchers of.it's been  a freaky Friday! You gotta help me!!!!! :((,5
I got this app turned it on walked around and as soon as I got in the room where my six year old was sitting it said child,4
"Its cool but I don't believe in ghosts sorry..only one ghost,the Holy Ghost.I don't even know if it works but it is fun to freak my friends out!",3
"It us pretty accurate,I took the words it was saying and put them together in Google and it came up as things they would say in an old mine which is what my home was built on top of,freaky",5
"I was reading a book waiting for this app to respond to me and the book was a novel called Knew it in a Moment and it said moment then the next day I thought well maybe it will respond again to the book so then I finished the book and at the end a lady died, the protagonists mom, and the app said mom, book, and deadAlso that same day I was wondering why the ghost was in my house and we bought the house from a man named Phil and I opened the app it said Phil followed by dad. Phil goes to our church and so Sunday I asked about his dad he said he moved away from that house because his dad died there and he felt too many memories of his dad",5
"My first try was a definite eye opener! I had this on my kindle before but never really used it. After having my Dad pass in March, I showed it to my Mom, and she said we should look in to it. So, I tried to download it from my cloud. It just said queued. But wouldn't load. After a few hours of this, my Mom gave up and went to bed. I went back into the app store and downloaded it again, and sure enough it worked!  So I turned it on and after just a few seconds it started showing dots and saying words! At the same time, the satellite on the tv went out, and Mom's 2 New puppies started to whine! The words were: March, song, highway, adventure, and Rocky. My Dad passed away in March, (last month) My Son played guitar and sang a beautiful song at his funeral. I spent a lot of time with my Dad having adventures on the highway, as we did a lot of traveling. And his passing was very Rocky to say the least. As soon as the dots were gone the puppies settled right down! I just wish I had someone with me at the time to be a witness. In Wisconsin 45yrs old.",5
ok app. first time I got it it said &quot;knife&quot; then showed a ghost RIGHT BEHIND ME. I don't really believe in ghosts and I know this app is fake but still...kind of freaks me out. also when it says words it can be kind of surprising. but it doesn't say stuff very often mostly it just sits there.,3
one time said chef but hasn't said anything else and I her a lot of red dots...it Kinda freaks me out,3
"So i got this app, and then when i played with is it said &quot;atom&quot; and &quot; learning&quot;. I kinda got freaked out bcause i was learning about atoms and was buliding two models. Like i think its accurate.",5
the app is amazing. me and my freinds do stuff and the app says stuff realated to what we did. the app is spooky but I love the app.,5
The ghost are trying to tell me something I just can't figure out what 1 told me to move so I moved and I think it sat down in my chair cuz I feel cool air there all tho my brother doesn't believe me idk why they won't talk to him. I hope my aunt comes to visit me for she is dead why couldn't my brother go fishing so I could talk with these spirits? Idk but this app works.,5
"This a nice amusement and who knows? I'm pretty sure ghosts exist, this app seems to pick up random energy or words and it is able to translate this into words, sounds and so on. It's fun.",4
this app is cool but can get really spooky sometimes because I would be walking around my house and nearly drop the thing on my foot for saying Bush or something.,5
this app is cool i like the concept havent really gotten snything noteworty yet but im sure i will! :) my complaint is thst the nag message for me to pay money wouldnt go away. i uninstslled but will reininstall. just hope it works.,2
this app is freaky true. if there is a green dot it is a good ghost. but if there is a red dot it is a evil ghost.and it shows you where the ghost is.,5
"this game is fun and believable, even my mom liked and believed it! The fact tht its free makes it even better :)",5
this is the greatest thing ever made in the histoy it shows ghosts. and it rocks your world get now.!!!!!!!!!,5
"This is the most awesome and accurate ghost app ever! I had the radar turned on in the living room while sitting beside my sister. Suddenly a dot appeared (forgot what color it was) and said &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34;. I looked over at my sister, who was playing Minecraft on her Kindle, and she was PLACING IRON BLOCKS! I screamed and showed my sister. Another thing happened when my friend, whose grandmother had passed earlier, was wearing a necklace her grandma had given her. I examined it with the radar on and it said &amp;#34;saved&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;grandmother&amp;#34;. OMG!! You MUST get this app!",5
This thing was awesome. I said to my friend in the dark that there was no ghost in the closetThen something on the screen said darkness so I got my water gun and went to the closet.My friend was now insane and he went crazy so  I sprayed him like 7 times and I got my room wet. : ),5
This was a fun app to play with. My kids enjoyed it as well. With Halloween coming up I will be using it to freak people out.,4
Used this a couple of times - pretty realistic radar screen. Would have liked to see more ghost stuff on it - was fun though.,4
Why would such a simple app.need SO many perms?  the description of this app was written in a way some of the perms make sence. DO NOT DOWNLOAD BEFORE READING PERMISIONS!,1
"Can't get the Classic version on the Kindle Fire, instead they want you to pay for the regular version.  Why would i want to buy the full version if i don't even know if it would work?!?!  They should offer this Classic version for free to Kindle Fire people too!!! Disappointed!",1
"3 years ago of April 1, my dog Benjamin died. A few weeks ago i was in my bedroom where i have multiple pictures of him, and suddenly my ghost tracker said &quot;Benjamin.&quot; It really freaked me out. Then i took it to my church and it said Jesus. then a few minutes later it said bible, christ, and church... very scary",5
"As soon as I got in the app there were 3 red dots. A little more than a year ago I lost 3 great grandparents all in one day. It said great, grand, daughter, and miss",5
do not get me wrong.i do like this app.its that this app takes a long time to pick up a ghost.,3
Don't ever download an app that needs this much access to your information.  Especially one that doesn't do anything. Please don't be naive!,1
downloaded this words that come up are &quot;find&quot; and &quot;soldier&quot;. my moms dad was in the army he had died because of a wound he got this app is cool first I thought it was deceptive cause it showed a tiny half dot when I walked on the stairs but now I love it.,5
"Great app! I'm a paranormal investigator so I know this app truly works. Also, Lana D- your one stupid bitch for trying to summon Bloody Mary. If u don't know what your doing then don't do it. Silly girl.",5
I am still checking this one out.  My anti-virus program though is telling me this is adware so I might have to take it out.,3
I don't believe in ghost I know they don't exist so I don't know and u cant fool me saying u saw a real ghost I don't believe in that junk,3
I dont believe in ghosts but this is a great app. to have fun with and entertain friends. Turn it on while you tell some ghost stories around the campfire and it will freak your friends out that much more!!!,4
"I downloaded this and within minutes a ghost appeared to my right and said, &quot;Sucker&quot;, &quot;Phony&quot;, and &quot;Uninstall&quot;. Who am I to argue with a ghost? Uninstalled.",1
I enjoy this app very much. I use it around the house and when I go to jobs that are in historical buildings or homes. I like it when it picks up a word and shows on the radar where the activity is. I get alot of hits in what was the kitchen in my 189 year old house.,4
"if you think this is actually going you any type of results. ghosts aren't real, and either its your intelligence.",1
I got these words &quot;BETSY&quot; &quot;HIDDEN&quot; &quot;FORTY&quot; &quot;GASOLINE&quot; and &quot;POT&quot;  I believe that there was a woman named &quot;Betsey&quot; who is hiding and side when she was forty by smoking pot with gasoline somewhere around,5
I just bought the game and opened it I was leasing with my hair then it said hair then a blue dot alerted behind me I closed the app after that haven't had it more than 3 minutes,4
"im confused on this wierd app. it says things and tries to scare u. nothing happened so far that it said. its just, not the best app...at all. it is alittle....alot....creepy",2
It's  fake. His name is Johnathan and it says random words for a minute I thought it was real but it isn't. Random words pop up and the dots disappear??!! Don't get it its a scam!!!!!!!! Beleave me its fake don't buy it!!,1
it totaly works...i was at my neighbors and weird things started happening and this app picked it all up plus my mom asked a question and a spirit responded emidiatly...it was no coincedence it was real and it happened and we all ran lol,5
"just downloaded, no option available for settings adjustment. or instructions.  how no clue what the app is picking up.  can anyone help?",2
my house was built by a man and in the end of building he died. I got this app and I was in the room where he died in a fire and the words &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;lamp&quot; showed up. the guy tipped over a lamp and burned. totally creeped me out!,5
"Not impressed, this could have been so much better. This runs a little different on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; than it did on my Apple IPod. I know it's just for fun, but sometimes I say things are just a little too coincidental.",3
okay so I was at my great grandmas house and I put it by her doll case (she makes dolls by hand) and 6 dots showed up and it said &quot;child&quot; and that was reallllly creepy. I think it works I just like it because its entertaining. I just did it again and a red dot showed up in my room and it said &quot;yard&quot; and that's where my dog Is burried. I loved my dog a lot too. he died in December. first day of winter break at school. (he was a Corgi blue healer mix so he was like a giant corgi),4
Ok so like within the first five minutes I had caught a ghost and had heard sounds around me. Then it came up with the word &quot;twelve&quot; and that is how old I am. this is really freaking me out. I don't know if it is real or fake but this is just plain weird.,3
ok so when i got this app the first thing i did was wait until night a turn the radar on. the first word it said was Dan. my friend Dan had just left 5 seconds before the reading! then it said my name Cam 5 minutes later! this app is really creepy!  O.O,4
so I bought this app Cu's I think my house is haunted and I wanted to tell if ghosts were really.haunting my house. but in 10 mind I had 2 get an ultrasound. I turned it on and it was silent for a while. then I said in thisorder hospital aid towels sheets it creeped me out I knew all of those things would be happening but I think if u believe in ghosts defiantly get btw I hve classic one,5
"so I was in my room and this glass clown fell on my head so I got and ice pack and then I sat back down and ot said ice and I was like :0! ot also has said constant, small ,popular ,bigger, revenge ,poem",5
So I was sitting on the couch... playing my kindle fire... and well it was really scary cause... I live in Norway and it said &quot;Norway&quot; then after that I wanted to go swimming... and it said &quot;swimming&quot; and the time was noon.... and it said&quot;noon&quot; and I put the kindle fire down on the couch.... and ran outside screaming**),5
Super creepy. it said something but I got so scared that I exited the app before it was done talking,5
"This app does absolutely nothing. If you want an app that only drains your battery so you can lie to your friends and be the entertainment for the night, this would be it. Otherwise, it's just a waste of time to download.",1
"this completely freaked out my sisters and one of their friends I am mad at one of them for downloading this stupid app. we went in our living room, it was nothing, then one sister said nothing lets go, we walked 2 steps than the friend said look we looked at the screen there was 2 blue dots and it said lion. still shivering.  tots freaked out.  parents are taking this as an advantage to scare us.",1
we got this because my cousin heard a sound and we dicided to go ghost hunting then almost e erysipelas time we went in that room we saw a floating blue light. It works definetly.,5
"Well, my sister and I were on the couch and decided to put this on quick while we're watching it my sister fixes her pony tail the word &quot;pony&quot; comes up on the screen..........AKWARD",4
this is a fun game that i play almost everyday. i love the features andi like the different levels.,5
Totally stupid. It was a waste of space on my Kindle. My husband downloaded it. I would never download something like this.,1
"I work in a building that is 150 years old. I was going #2 in the bathroom and it told me a ghost said ""light"", ""match"". C'Mon! My stomach is a little upset.. give me a break, it cant smell that bad?",4
"Although the readings were things we didn't really understand, it was still an adventure. I reccomend this because it gives you something to do c:",4
At Sunday morning I downloaded this and after two minutes it said &quot;you&quot;and &quot;die&quot; then I was worried that he might kill me and said to myself &quot;don't be ridiculous&quot;so I went for a drive to forget what the ghost said after leaving the house I had a huge car crash but now I'm ok . all nonbelievers I warn you to watch what your reading.,5
Great app but had to uninstall because it would not transfer to as card and I am out of internal memory. That is why it is 4 stars and not 5,4
"I first turned this on when the power in the house shut off. it showed that there were 3 ghosts in front of me. I asked what their names were. my kindle said &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, and &quot;David&quot;. I looked up the house's history. and that was the family who.lived in the house about 50 years ago. I was so stunned and amazed! this app is a MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!",5
I installed this on my kindle..the first time it scanned it showed dot on the radar and my grandfathers name came up..not his real name but we called him. There is no way that it could have known this info or gotten it from ANY source on my kindle in anyway what so ever. So I have to believe there might be something to this..as much as I don't want to. Becareful because it could seriously freak someone out. Especially someone who believes in ghosts.,4
I just walked out the door and a freakn' ghost was right in front of me. Oh my God! Now my dog is barkingand running around going crazy.,3
I love it. I actually stepped on a red ghosts foot:) if your looking for a scary app you came 2the right place.,5
I really like this app. I was watching You Tube on my Xbox and the radar said &quot;Tube.&quot; It was creepy!,5
I saw a red dot on my screen it was in my mom's room then I heard a cracking noise which was the same sound as someone getting off the bed that gave goosebumps,5
"It works. I'm sure my neighbor's house is haunted. Why? Because I was walking by his house (his name is Paul) and a red dot came in his house and the word Paul came up. I got chicken skin and I ignored it. Paul's son is named David, and I said I would laugh if the word David came up. As soon as I said laugh, the word laugh came up. Now I really cot creeped out. Later, I found out the house was built in the early 1900s and in an epidemic of small pox that affected most of Honolulu's Chinatown, some people died...",5
"I use this app when the grand-kids visit us, they get a kick out of it. Some of the words it says give me a cold chill, but it's still fun.",3
I was on this app with my friend and it said go then away then we refused to leave so something fell on my head;( it hurt soooooo mean for a ghost to do that and I also recomand the I phone app ghost detect you can talk to ghost and a ghost said run help.comeback spooky so I highlyy recomand that app:),5
Love all the different kinds of ghost and the ghosts say words and u can see where about the ghosts are at in your room..,5
"me and my bff were just being silly with this app. when we asked for it to say pie... it said &quot;pie&quot; 20 min later.  later on my brother Joe came in and the app said &quot;Joe&quot;. when my my dad was hanging up stuff. the app said, &quot;haung&quot;",5
me and my friend would not get the app if we weren't together.were 11 what do you think? were not flying superheros!!!  app is scary accurate I had my science project out and its was on planets the app said Mars!!!!!,4
my mother inlaw downloaded this app an showed me. i decided to download it on my kindle fire and my smart phone. loooooove it is all i can say. so.etimes the spirits are not active but othertimes they are. i have fun witb this app,5
Ok so I was just minding Mg own giddiness checking this app out and all of a sudden it said and my cat died yesterday!!! I was spool scared! U enjoy!!!,5
so for the past few days I have been expirencing weird things the past couple days. the scariest thing was when I was completely alone and I heard a loud growl in my ear. so when I saw this app and didn't really believe it would work. but when I turned it on there was a red dot next to my Christmas tree and then it said &quot;wrapped&quot; I was super creeper out!!,5
this app is really weird what do the red dots mean? there evrywere! this may sound strange but I can see most I know this sounds strange but I can talk to them last night a really scathe one came in my dream with brown hair never brushed or showered holding a basket full of cat heads and an army of headless cats behind her and she said &quot;you cant save the one who sees &quot; I'm the one who sees if you find me ever I can prove it later,5
this is real!!!!! me and my friend did and there was this ghost named Billy!! there was a guy named Billy that lived here before!! now we r hearing NOISES!! WE R CREEPED!! WE R GONNA GO CHECK IT OUT!!!,5
"This totally freaked me out... Its almost like it really works! Whenever I went into my living room I found one.. But when I stepped into my bedroom it went away.. When I stepped back into the living room AGAIN, it was still there :O Its like it knows what room ur in!! Maybe it does.. O_o... GET THIS APP NOW!!!!",4
Too funny. I started this up and the first thing it said was Thomas then room. funny thing is that is my cats name and he walked into my bedroom just then. I had a good laugh :),3
when I used this at home... it said ..you cold shiver random jinn...what surprised me is it said a jinn it means sin or devil ghost...and jinns are real...and um...I freaked out I couldn't stop shivering just like it said I would shiver...then it kept.on saying danger and then it said pray or die in not heaven.....uhhhh....,5
as others have said this app serves no purpose other than easy access to your account information for the writers. completely intrusive permissions for a simple app.,1
For those that don't understand the point of this app: It's pretty simple. Just look at the permissions required. It's just a front for stealing information. Why else would a simple novelty app need such intrusive permissions? Are there ghosts who have accounts on your phone or tablet?,1
"I just downlaoded this morning.I was waking past my brother when it said &quot;handsome&quot; and &quot;little&quot;.I told him they must mean you.he went nuts!!!!!he started running around the house.then we called called my granpa to see if we could inspect his house.downstairs. was nothing,but upstairs showed. a lot of ghosts.he said to this just a game because it scared my 5 year-old sister.but I knew it was real!!!!!!!",5
"Given all of the positive reviews, I wanted to give this app a try and sere for myself....I don't usually bother to write negative reviews, but this one is worth taking the time to weigh in on because it not only failed to end the least bit entertaining, but it also acts suspiciously viral since it keeps trying to reinstall itself after I uninstalled it.  Buyer beware!",1
I am 8 years old and I have phobia.I have phobia with lots of things espesially spirits or ghosts.This app is definately not for me.But my dad likes it though he is not scared of much because he is a police man.,1
i downloaded this thinking it would be interesting.  im a believer i guess even though ive never had any actual experiences.  tonight it did display some random words.  BUT the three words in a row that caught my attention was &quot;see casey thin&quot;.  this might not mean much to others but i lost my mum to cancer a year ago.  my sons name is case and we often call him casey.  he is also painfully thin because of his medical problems and the medication he is on.  how odd was that?  a voice from the other side or just random words that i put meaning to......,5
if u r a scaredy cat and cant handle scary stuff don't get it.it is that simple I seriously don't get why people think its fun to be scared I mean like you are worried what's going happen just live your life with a clean diaper Ps I think all you horror movie makers are sick and twisted my friend at school said when she was five she saw  a little&quot;ghost&quot;girl with a jump rope please give me a break people should have better things to do than sit their with a poopy diaper cause you are so scared and you are just sitting there in fear that a &quot;ghost&quot;will be in there,1
this is a bogus app... a hoax if you will. it's obvious the developers are just accessing your personal information since there is no such thing as ' ghost radar' lol.,1
"At first I did believe it, then I was like, ''Nah, it can't be true'' But boy wasI wrong!! The next day I got on the app. I still wasn't sure if it was real. I was just sitting on my bed, using the app ans still doubting it. But then a dot came up and the words spoken was COME  !! It SCARED me. I am freaked out right now!!!!!!!!! I totally believe",5
i downloaded it and thought it was fake but then.........i was playing around with it and it traked a ghost of a person who had the nickname of &quot;the jones&quot; and the word appeared &quot;jones&quot; and tons of other stuff but.....ill bore you,5
"I have used this app for over a year.  It has entertained me, my kids, my friends, my wife, my co-workers and so on.  I am a believer in ghosts, but a severe skeptic of this app.  Every now and then it'll creep you out by spouting relevant words and dots in relevant locations, but at least 75% of it appears to be random or void of energy spikes.  Anyone who takes this app too seriously is gullible and anyone who dismisses it completely is joyless.  It delivers fun and entertainment to believers and skeptics alike and should be used solely for entertainment.",5
"Okay so I bought this app and was like cool whatever and ignored it for a while. Today I looked at it in my room and I got a little activity. This is wat I got:(Top left corner activity level125) none realize | spreading log fire trouble | after that I was like woah is this real?and gotten word understanding. I shrieked and shut it off. Later I was watching the news when I saw a news report about a log fire at a camping sight. It had started 5 minutes before I started getting activity. Supposedly, some teenagers at a site  were  messing  around and then went to bed. None of the realized a fire had started and one of the teens was rushed to the hospital. So yea. Awesome app",5
"Ok my dad just got back from work for his lunch break and then it said job, next he turned on the tv and it said television. Creepy I'm 12kinda believe in ghosts won't do this when I'm alone. My mom has got to try this she is a huge believer and she is just amazed by ghosts. I would rate more but it creeps me out and makes me scared",4
"Ok people, God is real, the devil is real, and angels are real. So are spirits! Sometimes ghosts seek revenge, or they are friendly. This app is real. Here are what the signals : red, it is very strong. Yellow, strong. Green, weaker. Blue, barely there. This is real. Here's what it did to me one time: I was on my kindle fire on the couch, and it said &quot;wind&quot;. I thought it meant something, so I went to the weather channel. Believe it or not, but there was a big tornado watch in the south, thank goodness I don't live down there. I'm never trying in my bedroom, though. I'm afraid. I admit it. But this app is real. Trust me.",4
ok the app said love then broken and then described my bf and that same night I got a text from my bf saying he was breaking up with me!!!!,5
sometimes you get an app that is just for fun and works well this is one of them.  Dont think it really works but it is fun.  I like it thanks,3
This app actually works!I saw a ghost on the radar and I tried to touch it and the air felt colder where it was supposed to be.,5
This app is really creepy.One day I was sitting on the couch with my Chihuahua and he's small so I turned on the app and a couple minutes later it said little.then I was playing Xbox and then it said Game.Then a week later it said friend then my friend came over.Is it real or not.,5
"This is an awesome app. It kinda freaked me outEver since I've moved into my house I've been experiencing paranormal activity. When I first got into my house my mom was taking me on a tour. When we went upstairs and I felt a cold breeze (where my room is originally at.) When we were going back downstairs I felt like someone was watching me. 4 years later I got a kindle fire and I bought this app.I felt someone had fallen down our stairs, so I went on a couple of stairs, I saw nothing. I moved up a little more, and I saw 5 dots. Three were green one was yellow. All the other dots faded and one was left, and it was red and I all a sudden felt a cold breeze about up to my knees. When I first got the app I heard my name. Then I asked where do I live and it said America. I think it is my great grandfather because he had passed away not very long ago.So this really touches me that I know he is still with me.I really think you should buy this it really works",5
um... so a couple weeks ago i had a friend over and she told me to put on the ghost hunter app well i did and i havethis bracelet on my ankle i took it off and the ghost detector said push with a red dot and so i got up to put tue bracelet back on all of a sudden it felt like some one pushed me (i didnt get hurt) i asked my friend if she pushed me and she said no. and i can tell when she is lying. so its creepy u ppl should get it,5
weird I do mean weird real or not this is insane crazy I'm not sure if it's. real but it will make you think twice,5
"Well, I'm not that sure whether to believe this app or not. Me and my cousin were just messing around looking for ghost apps and we found this, and downloaded it. We were just watching the words out whatever and it kept saying 'ffee' and we were confused. At the top it said 'Get'and that kinda scared me. I tried joking around and trying to communicating to the 'ghost'. At the top, it said 'Observe'. My cousin said, &amp;#34;What is your name?&amp;#34; And it said 'Joe' and then a huge yellow dot appeared in front of us, and the top said 'Shimmering' It scared me really badly, and I deleted the app instantly. Not because I don't like it, because I was FREAKED OUT. You choose whether to believe it or not..",5
"well its entertaining thats for sure. only says one word at a time,but its fun by the campfire telling ghost storys then freak the kids out :)",4
"When i first got this app, i was a little skeptical about it but tried it anyway cuz im 13 like what 13 yr old wouldn't get this?! XD so anyways i was changing in my laundry room with this app on and the word appeared &quot;change&quot; i freaked out and told my parents but they wer just laughing at me, it's real like 80% of the time i recommend trying it out it's pretty cool!!! :D",4
I Played This Game Few Months Then Werid Things Started To Happen.  I Heard Noise In My Closet.  I Open It But There Was No One.  I Was Like Crap . I Was Watching Wipeout I Heard This Roaring Noise.  I Got So Scare  . I Went Into My Mom Room. But She Didn't Answer. So I Went Back Watching It.  Then I Heard It Again. I Ran To My Mom Screaming Open The Door.  Then I End Up Sitting On The Floor Ready To Scream But My Mouth Was Closed.  She Came Out Finding Me Sitting On The Floor Scared Like Crap.  She Was So Sweet To Me.  I Went To Bed.  The Next Day. Was The Creepy.  I Was Watching All That On TeenNick. 90 . Then The Remote. Start Turning By It's.  Self. I Turn Back I Was So Scare But Awesome App I Tell You More . Earlier In The Morning I Was Eating A Pop Tart And Watching Spongebob Squarepants. . I Was Playing That Game Until It Said Talmage.  I Was Like Is Talmage Is A Name.  I Ask My Mother. She Said Yep. That Means We Have A Ghost In Our House.  I Was So Scared.  Those Were Those Movies.  I Felt Like Kicking The Ghost.  GREAT NOW MY SISTER IS SAYING GHOST BECAUSE OF TALMAGE THE SPIRT . IM SO MAD,5
I think it is a cool app but I don't think it is real because its always. making weird sounds. so don't get it please it is a waste of time.by Chyanne. Hamlin,3
I was heading to my cousins birthday party and had this app up an I was staring at the screen and nothing else and then right in front there was a red dot and it said wreck I look up and there was a car wreck right in front of us! Later (still on my way) a little to the left I see a yellow dot and it said holy I look up a little to the left in front of us there's a church! If your littler and its at night and your looking at this app it will scare you to death!,5
omg yesterday I got this app and I love it.A couple of years ago (maybe 2) my great grandmother died.I am 10 right now.I went around my house playing this.I went into my living room.Sitting there waiting for a singnal I picked something up.Then I felt a cool breeze then back to normal temperature.Then I felt a tickle on my head then the screen had nothing on there I was terrified.,5
there's this vacant house next to ours I tricked.my cousin but this app really freaked her out she wont even go near the driveway it was funny I did it in my friends house and it creaped me out but it was fun ha ha ha ha ha,5
This is fake that makes me mad I am a real paranormal investigator and fake apps like this makes us look bad should make  real parnormal investigating to help people no fake apps just to take peoples money,3
Very creepy. I got a couple blue then I got a red in the middle. (I said grandpa?!) Fun app. Going to try it at every old house I go to.,4
"wasnt thrilled with this, i tried it a couple times and even though its purely for entertainment i found it to be boring and useless and i removed it. i think people watch all those new ghost shows and convince themselves this app is real and will give real results...sorry folks not true.",2
"I downloaded this today, I was bored in bed haven't been feeling well. As soon as I turned it on it said > Maria &lt; and last night I had a dream with an old acquaintance & that's her name. It then said Jack, Army, Knife, Rifle. I do have a knife next to my bed gift from my son a Marine. I came downstairs, where I have all my pets, a small dog, a very playful kitten, and 3 birds. It repeated like four times > animal &lt; and when the kitty started running around and playing it kept repeating > energy &lt; My dog was biting her nails on her left paw, and that's what it said > bite &lt;> left &lt;. Then it said > Barbara &lt; and that's the name of the street I live in. I've had paranormal experiences since a young age, so this doesn't scare me its quite fun. If you know how to use it and what to ask, believe me its worth to download.",5
I got this app and when I tried it out alot of dots appeared it was scary then I was in the kitchen pouring a cup of koolade and it says &quot;pleasant&quot; I told my sis to come in the kitchen and I tell her what happened and after I was done it said &quot;correct&quot; we freaked out.,5
it is cool how it tracks vibrations and noise. I use this app a lot. I love pie and cake and cookies. I am 7 yrs old. hahaha.,5
I was sitting down stairs watching Tv and it said chang so I changed the channel for a split second and a dot showed up and then vanished just as quick as the channel changed back,5
the only reason I give it a four cause I went to my great grandmqs house and it said there was a ghost there then it said my grandmas name! then I just ran in the front yard it was creepy!,4
"This app is no joke, brah. Works real well, not many lags, and freaked out my friend's nephew! Worth your time. And the messages don't repeat, just proof this is real.",5
I really like playing around with this app its fun to c what words it will say next(and other times a little freaky) sometimes it says things that fit into the convo that's going on or answers questions which is sorta freaky haha! I have passed this on to someone who also passed this app on and it actually went on for a while :). thanks for making this app,5
it worked great! it told me I was surrounded with ghosts so I packed and left my house haven't been back for 2 years. well now I know my house is haunted because of this app.,5
me and my friend like 2 use this app a lot.we espescially use it when we're in his basement with all the lights out and we've been getting a lot of activity.Eventually we started taking pictures with our phones when a ghost would appear and we've gotten some shots with orbs and unexplained mists.(we think it is real),5
"Not bad, but not really good. O.K. for a little entertainment. But it gets old quick.  Just not for me.",3
the radar sends signals mabye its like scans everything if it was real its creepy but crazy and remember God is with us,5
I had my eye on this app 4 a long time but was too afraid to get it.  my cousin was over tonight and we were both terrified to get it but she talked me in to it so I got it.  for the first couple times it said random words like &quot;goes&quot; or &quot;wagon&quot;.  but after a couple hours it said July which is when my cousin's birthday is.  she freaked and we were so scared! :0,4
"I rated 4 stars,because it sometimes creeps you out! I don't think this is REAL ((xD)),but its quite entertaining :3",4
have a kindle fire and it works fine on it...and as far as i know..it doesnt steal your info.  Its a fun app. and its free.,5
I love this game but it is very scary. I got it about a month ago and it said grandmother. my grandmother died so this is scary ;/,5
"I've had paranormal experiences since I was very young.  Others around me have witnessed some of them.  Whether you feel this app works or not, like God, the spirit world knows what you're doing.  Be careful and use this app outside your home.  Don't take the chance inviting something in or opening a doorway you can't close.",3
Tuesday's. seem to be the most active.I had 15 words and 3 were concerning my deceased son which I no was from him because it mentioned balloons. I had yellow orbs red green blue they sometimes are in pairs.I turn ghost radar on at the same each evening.my son passed away in my home 3 yrs ago.we have a picture that was taken the day of his memorial same camera the middle picture shows a white orb the picture before and after it is not in it.the camera was stationary,5
I love this app. me and my brothers and sisters play this and make a.joke out of it. Like when we go to restaurants. we say their haunted!,5
It tells you what a ghost is saying. And it tells you were the ghost is. It is relly cool!!!,4
I was surrounded by red dots... everywhere I went though there was always one red dot directly on me... is this normal? because I figure you wouldn't need to mark the middle of a radar... its pretty obvious where the center of a radar is...,3
"I'm 10 and here's what happened. my dad told us that we had learner a lesson and the tracker said Lesson. then, my little sis said bill which is her way of saying the b word and the tracker said bill. I was using a kindle fire. now I'm scared for life",1
"It looks real, but I'm saying, Ighh. Get this. Its fine. But if you love jokes, get this. A big trick on you. I love this app, since its intertaining for kiddos!",4
Im not sure yet if I should download this. I don't believe in ghosts but maybe it would creep me out too much. lol,5
"You know why you can't get it on Kindle Fire? It doesn't have a camera, and all devices you can download on do. It utilizes the camera without you knowing, and it identifies the object and says the word. This explains why it needs so much information- it wires to the camera. I didn't realize this until I read you couldn't get it on the fire and it uses a lot of info. If you don't beleive me, you don't, but an app can't utilize 1,000-5,000 dollar equipment.",1
"People complain, but why? Did you expect ghosts to pop up and have interesting conversations with you and follow you around 24/7 ? Have some fun with it, try to figure out why it does what it does, mess with minds of believers if you wish. But learn to have fun, not be critical when uncalled for,  and don't complain about a program you didn't have to install anyway. Most enjoy showing how easy it is to replicate the goofy stuff on TV. That is fun. Some people like to have fun and be mock serious, just as some of you like to carry on to get a reaction. Stop flaming and REALLY PAY ATTENTION to what they say. IF the program is excessive in battery usage, that's a claim to consider. Most of the other stuff is petty. Others having problems with this program draining battery?",4
was with friend it said castle we looked at my clay castle and then it said observe we got scared,5
"I have had this app for a day and already I am enjoying it! And I think I got those colors and dot shapes down. Red=demon/evil Yellow=unknown ghost Green= friendly ghost/friend or family Blue=angel. I have heard about the colors being how strong their signal is, but how do you explain the fading? I believe THAT is how you tell how strong their signal is. Oh and if you look carefully, you can see that some are round and some are square. Round=girl/female Square=boy/male. And then you see these random letters at the the bottom left. I think these are the sounds it is picking up. It does talk, and when it does it usually says very random words like, Sam, of, Sell, Enter. You probably won't understand them most of the time, and that's ok. Oh and if you notice that the color may change from green to red or yellow to green, etc. That's natural. But you may want to slay those red ones. :P I use a fake sword. It is fun. :) Overall, it is a great app. It is up to you if it is real or not. It is only real if you let it seem real. I go halfway because it has some fake qualities. But have fun with it! I know I am! P.S. I think I have a ghost that likes me. :P",5
"I have been constantly dreaming of my mom and feeling haunted by her.  she died 11 years ago. I ran across this app today and had to try it.  I recently got a new wedding ring that I have been walking around my house gazing at.  a red dot appeared today and the word Mrs. was spoken!  the question of my ex appeared (his name)  followed by Available.  key words that only I would understand kept appearing.  my oldest son was a baby when my mother died. I allowed him to try and speak with her,  a red dot appeared and the word Giant and My was said.  too many on point coincidences for me.  I say it is worth the download if you are curious.  But be careful!  you never know what or who you are inviting in your home.",5
"Use to doubt the claims by developer, until I used it for an investigation and it gave intelligent responses. Reccomend this app highly, lots of fun to use.",5
"guys, the colors mean how strong the signal is red very strong yellow strong green weaker blue weakest ( minimum=annoying",4
I am so scared I don't know wat I should do if I should download it cud I know I'm gonna get freaked out,5
"ok first of all, you are NOT inviting spirits into your house by getting this app. no offence but some of u people don't know what your talking about. this app helps communicate with spirits. it does not attract spirits and its not like an ouija in ANY way, shape, or form. so have fun with it and don't worry :)",5
"At first I was skeptical of this app, but right when I started it the app said ""chair""...I was laying in bed with my desk chair facing me and the phone. So i kinda thought it somehow used the phone's camera, I was at the store and it said shelf and then I got shivers and it said breeze. But the big selling point was when I was in my room changing and the app said change...the phone was on my bed with the camera facing the sheets so it wasn't the camera.I don't know if its 100% accurate or real but its probably 75% entertaining and 25% real. Kinda like a ouija board thats sold as a game but then theres creepy stories about it.But its fun when it talks, usually a lot of silence.",5
ok so my sister said the word lady and I was on this app and right after that the ghost said lady!  sericky get it it works on kindle fire weirdly you need to get it!!!!,5
"I got this app once before and a friend and I decided to put it to the test in her dads home which is a &quot;historical monument &quot; and has been around for ages and is haunted. so when we put it to the test it started saying things like &quot;single, Buddy, lazy, Tv, footsteps&quot; and more which was creapy as we were both single, her cat Buddy was laying with us, we were being lazy and watching Tv and then we heard footsteps right behinde us which is super creapy when you're home alone in a haunted house. so after that we decided to put it to the test at her moms house which is a smaller ranch style house and it started saying things like &quot;nine, cats, Tim&quot; which was also weird as she has 9 cats and we were holding her brothers mouse Tim. now our last two tests came up when we came to my house (the next day)  where it was having a field day going off with all this country crape and my house is only 5 years old and were the only people who have lived in it but the words &quot;pitbull, fighting, drugs, fire, gun and beer &quot; came up which was freaky because earlyer that year we had found out more on the history of my neighborhood and there were people (before this was a neighborhood)  who bred and fought pits here and were wanted by the police for drugs and we had found the burnt remains of some of this. so we took it to the old barn where it was crazy we didn't know what to do as word after word came up &quot;cow, barn, plow, old&quot; and more. then today it decides to remind me that I'm single and am laying in bed with my cat....to many to be a coincide.",4
I just walked in the spare bedroom with the app on. I've been trying to decide what to do with the room and the first word said was &quot;decide&quot;. Then a blue dot showed up right where my mothers urn is in that same room. I don't know whether to laugh or change my shorts!,5
"Okay, so I downloaded it and turned it on.  At first there was nothing happening but then it started lighting up all over the place. I was watching &quot;Moby Dick&quot; with the volume up high. It said, &quot; look&quot;, &quot; letter&quot;, &quot;auithor&quot;, &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;William&quot;. I turned the volume off and asked,&quot; William who?&quot; No response so far although a hurricane warning from msnbc did pop up while I was typing this and scared the crap outta me. This is so cool. Hehehe!",5
I was waiting for it to say something so I was flipping through the channels on my radio. Then it sayed STATION. You should buy this app.,4
"so I lived in this house and we new it had a ghost or 10 so I got this app to see if it works and there was a lot of red dots and my dad moved in with us not to long ago and his name is mark and then he left for work one day and me and my mom pulled out my kindle fire we were playing around with the app and then it said &quot;sunlight,MARK,help, leave &quot;and we had just bot a new home and we think it is mad we r moving and now it keeps hurting us so we don't move.this app works well get it.",5
I used to have this app a while back and it said my step dads name and it scared me so bad I cried but then they calmed me down and I haven't downloaded it since but besides being scary it can be fun,5
"Okay, about a month ago, I was in my room getting ready for school. I was in a cross between: a Gryffindor  sweat shirt with worn skinny jeans and Ugg boots or a Camp Half Blood t shirt with skinny jeans and high tops. So I asked the Ghost Radar,&quot; Oh wise and powerful ghost in my room, which shall I WEAR?!&quot; I waited.and waited.and waited. then I freaked out. it said:&quot; Wear, sweat, shirt&quot;I literally cried out in excitement!!!!! This ghost had taste like a huge nerd like me!!!!!Theresa(:",5
"I just got this, and so far it's done nothing but scan. However, it has inspired a creepy story that I want to write. That alone earns 5 stars.",5
"Has some information that helps in knowing what phase the moon is as well as what sign it in as well if it is a void or not.  It is fine for free, but nothing that you can do by looking at the calendar.  Sometimes you get information on some things then others it wont help at all.",3
"It's not what I thought it would be, it would be better if it had more information, and the actual moon and explain more on void or not to void and the zodiac a little better",3
"Being born in the sun sign of Cancer, I'm a moon child through and through. To actually be able to chart the moon, gives me more insight, and understanding. I've always been aware that the phases of the moon,deeply affect me! But now I get daily details. :) I love this app. It's another great astrological tool, in my apps. Thank you!!",5
I love the moon and now to have the cycles at my finger tips is awesome... glad my friend saw the app!!!,5
Boring didn't get it.  Would not recommend it.  Want money back. Not worth it  not for me. Would not order again,2
Great for planning to plant a garden  ( above ground plants when moon waxes and root plants when it wanes ),5
"I like this app a lot.  It is simple but precise. Not a lot too it, but fine for what it is.",4
"Don't listen to the nay sayers. This app actually does work. It creeps me out to. My dad asked it a question and it answered him. I've asked it questions and it answered me. If you're into the paranormal stuff, I highly recommend this app.",5
"This would be great for kids at a slumber party or for really naive adults who believe every speck of dust in a picture is an orb.I bought the free version and I liked it well enough and then I bought the paid version which is no different from the free version in any noticeable way.With the paid version, it's almost as though it is setup to shoot out random words and phrases at a certain interval. Maybe they thought people would get their moneys worth that way to give people who paid for it more fake excitement? It seems that way to me.If you're into the paranormal, I would download the free version just if you're curious but don't buy the paid version. The free version is better, in my opinion.Don't expect this to be a serious tool--it's just a toy.",3
this app cant do anything on the kindle fire and someone talking to Katy perry's ghosts? Shes not dead just so you know,1
"so I bought this house fro. a guy that passed away. words so far &quot;interior, mine, shade&quot; and so on. he was an artsy fartsy guy and I've redone the interior. also have a wall that's only windows and haven't put shades. interesting.",3
i used this app and it said that all the reviews here with more than one star were from ghost writers.....,1
"it kept giving me battery, life, eviction, and dog, and I couldn't figure it out.  finally, after turning on the radar, I saw the phone point to itself.  I ran to my local church, and had the priest do an exorcism on my phone, and sure enough, after the excorcism, my phone battery now lasts twice as long.  on a side note...I knew that yappy dog next door was posessed, and after shooting it with holy water, it burst into flames.",5
"My friend and I were really scared until after five minutes, nothing. showed up. I recommend this app for little wimps. but this is a rip off. Well, it's not really rip off when you can scare younger kids. It's still stupid though.  :(",2
I have this application also on my ipad with the same settings and they don't get anywhere near the same results.so far all I've gotten are totally wrong words. like &quot;sister&quot;. I've never had a sister.,1
"I can see my own kind, I'm not blind or mabye I am. Anyway I go to the graveyard yo see my buddy Jeff, it did not detect his presance AT ALL!!! Then I go to walmart and A BILLION FAKE GHOSTS WERE THERE!!!!! I think this is THE AVERAGE SHOPPER RADAR!!!!! It kept saying FOOD and SALES and BUY. WHAT?!?!?!  At least say what kind of app this is. MAYBE ITS A TYPO?!?! Well ALWAYS READ REVEIWS. Three stars cause it does something. SO IF NEED YOU TO FIND THE AVERAGE SHOPPER BUY THIS. Btw...BOOOOOOO!",3
"For y'all folks that thought it actually works , it dosen't. It's just a way to entertain yourself. It's also a way to prank your friends into believing your crazy made up ramblings and making them parinoid. I know cause I've done it. It's hillarious. Anyways, while I do beloved in ghost ,there's no reason to take this so seriously. I mean the company or whatever that made this is named spud pickles so you shouldn't really believe it. That's like trusting someone named seedy. It is a fun game. It's funny to watch parinoid people freak out over it (I always explain to them that its fake after I stop laughing) . I like it .",5
This app is useless without a delete button so you can get rid of these pests once and for all...,1
Just reading these reviews are worth paying for app.  This has been thoroughly entertaining.  You can take it seriously or not.  Doesnt matter.  Its free.,5
Love this app. Its scaring me though! But its loads of fun! I totally reccommend this! Kinda freaky!!! Great to scare anyone with!,5
this app really creeps out my friends.  of course i didnt tell them that its a game.  great ice breaker and it can sure revive a lagging conversation!!!,5
"This app used to work great for me. I searched out many spirits, most of whom became fast friends (well, some of them were a bit decayed and they weren't so fast).My issues began after my recent demise in a construction accident. I wound up in a number of pieces. It can be quite challenging to keep track of all of them. This application does an adequate job of finding the big pieces like my legs but isn't sensitive enough for my fingers and nose. Since the little pieces are the ones that usually get lost, this is a serious drawback.",3
"well when i first got it i was joking with it then i realized, i shouldn't because of my past experiences. some freaky things happened. for instence, things flying, me levitating. so maybe just be careful. you don't ever know what will happen. don't open doors you cant close....",5
"According to this app, it's 'scientific'ly 'correct' I will be 'hanged' by the 'Japanese'.Ghost Radar is an application that supposedly detects spirits with your device. Good layout and great for young children. It's up to you to believe if this is real or not. I use it mainly for creativity purposes.",4
Works great on Tmobile G2.  One of the most important applications on Amazon it helps you detect ghosts and spirits.  I already found a ghost in my bedroom.,5
"I tried this program out just for fun. well the radar was showing large amounts of activity around me- and to make matters worse it was giving me back snippets of my own thoughts! Like when i thought it was weird, it gave back WEIRD. when i thought ha ha that's kinda creepy it gave back CREEPY. I thought about ice cream just to mess with the train of thoughts, and it gave back DAIRY,  followed by COLD afterwards.Then it hit me. I am a ghost.It took some remembering, but i died years back in a car accident, and i had been in denial this whole time.Thanks to this app, i was able to realize that i had passed on, and finally cross over. well. not yet. i am writing this before i finally rest. :)",5
me and my friend like to go ghost hunting we call our selves E and M ghost hunters wen I saw this app I got it works great.,5
I absolutely LOVE that this is the FAOtD from Amazon! i had the free version for a while and my kids loved playing with it! Now have the ad free version to keep them entertained! Yes its mainly for entertainment purposes but when can keep both a 12 year old and an 8 year old side by side for an hour or better its GREAT! Thanks Amazon for this!,5
"I thought, our at least hoped, this was some kind of game - there's another ghost radar app that is actually fun and useful . This, unfortunately is a total waste of time.",1
This is a very fun app. Findings have to be read cautiously but a lot of fun for those interested in the paranormal.,5
had it on for 10 minutes and no words or ghosts! my house has no ghosts! wanna send some over here? lol,4
what does : or pig park exciting somehow havent : mean?  im scared. theres a place called pig park down the street and i night i always hear voices in my house.,3
I got this app pretty scared because i think my house is haunted so i put it up and ghosts were popping up like crazy i got so scared now i cant put it down. It is so scary. If you dont like ghosts this app is not for you. It is a MUST get app.,5
I downloaded this application and opened it while I was in the car. there was the occasional blip on the radar screen but nothing significant. and while there were a few words that appeared it was meaningless and random at best. but... when I got home and turned it on it was a different story. not sure what the different colored dots mean however there were many dots and many words being spoken in my house. I was standing in the kitchen and thought to myself what was I just gonna do? it was it that moment that the word &quot;pot&quot; appeared on the screen. oh yeah that's right I was gonna go have some pot. so off to the garage me and probly most of the ghost in the house went to get our bake on. truly this is an amazing application full of surprises and dare I say a mind reader.,5
"The reviews are the very best for this game.  I laughed out loud.  It is a little creepy when it says strange words.  But if you've ever spent an afternoon in the nursing home, it's pretty much the same thing.",3
What this is suppose to do can't be proven to be actual I do not take the blips and the words seriously. You can have fun with it anyway.,3
"Don't waste your money. I was hoping some how, some way this app would pick up on something. But everytime I moved my kindle a word would just so happen to pop up. It was fun the first day but now it just makes me mad when I turn it on.",1
"It is a fun app but at the same time it never stops!  All day I get messages of ""words spoken"".  It never shuts off and keeps going.  When words are spoken it never makes sense at all.  I'll get ""fire"" ""Norway"" ""also"", it just throws random words out.  But I do like it the kids have a lot of fun with it so I let them go on their own ghost adventure.  So for fun factor I gave it 3 stars.  Obviously it's not real and I never expected it to be but when I shut down an app in my phone I would like it to stop.",3
"The app is for entertainment purpose only, but its poor user interface and sounds make it an immediately uninstall.I would NOT recommend this application.",1
See people thinks these apps work. Really?  If it wasn't. for free I won't. waste my money. If you like faking someone out this is the app for you.,3
"Thanks to this app I found out that my house is haunted.While I was working on my computer I fired this app up having no idea what to expect. I clicked on the ""Radar"" button and it showed 3 blue dots to my right, and 2 yellow ones in front of me. Then my phone says, ""Ignore"". I figure it's telling me to ignore the dots. (Which I assume were ghosts)?Then my phone starts popping off word after word. Are these ghosts having a conversation? It seemed like all nonsensical words. Well after a couple of minutes of this I said aloud, ""Go away ghosts, I'm trying to work here!""Suddenly the radar went blank and for the next 20 minutes not another word came out of my phone. I finished my work and turned the app off.Freaky Man!",4
"Great FAOTD.  Started the app started to show words on Vox and in the Radar. Funny thing in the Radar was showed location and word &quot;creature&quot;, I look towards the area it pointed and it was my dog. jeje, great app for Halloween",4
not sure if it really works ...I'd like to think it does in some way or another...prob be better with a smart phone or something with more &#34;sensors&#34; to it. But its fun and interesting. If I had a smart phone I'd have it on there too and compare results....I think its worth getting...thanks  SPUD PICKLES!,4
my house is free of ghost... except one who knew inwould spread and strecth far the accuracy of this app... its is cool for halloween thou,5
"So I just got this app today and as soon as I got on it, a word popped up said Sit. Which was weird bc I was sitting. so I started to say some names. names I said Grandma Brown, Grandpa Brown, Ben, Grandpa Wallace. then it popped up a word saying Fewer. then a few words came up I didn't understand like Fox, Entry and Simply. then I asked who this was and it popped up Dan Just now. It really creeped me out bc my dads name is Dan (he has not passed yet). Going to wait it out before I make my review a 5 star. I really recommend getting this app if you are into parnormal stuff.",4
"This app is good! Not the best but definitely worth a dollar! But the reason its 4 stars is because there are different colors of ghosts and there is no key to defining what they stand for. Other than that, good job!",4
"what a perfect app for Samhain and All Hallows!my 1st grader is having a blast finding ""ghosts""I only wish they would stop restarting the app even when I FC it... i dont wanna hafta get physical. (I ain't afraid of no ghost, mmkay?)It found ""energy"" in my wifes altar, I just thought that was chuckle worthy",2
"Decent app, works on my phone with no negitive effects. Weither it ACTUALLY percieves the super natural or paranormal is unknown. However, even if not, it is a fun entertainment piece just in time for halloween.",5
I can't wait for the next app to come out of beta.  demon sonar.  every time I try to find the demons in the toilet bowl after drinking the ghosts make the app crash by shorting out my phone.  we need an app that can keep up with todays ever more aggressive sprite world,4
It only said potatoes... I am a born-again Christian and ghosts don't exist they are demons playing with people making them believe idiotic paranonal crap. I do accept the fact that this app is humorous however because the developers name is Spud Pickles lol,5
"Ok i think we all know this app is entertaining,but really? It started going off with words like gulf,boat,fall,thy,what kind of message is it trying to get across to me. i mean I'm in a 14 story building and its telling me a ghost is next to me,why would there be a ghost in a condo on the beach? don't get it its a total waste of time and money.",2
me and my friend were going around his house at night then these dots and words came up.the word said living room.so we went to the living room.then it said cabinet.so we checked the only cabinet.in there was my friends grandmas favorite teapot set.it kinds spooked us.but overall this is a fun game.and its up to you to decide if you think its real or not.hope you enjoy it:),5
IT SCARES THE FLIP OUT OF ME! Seriously even my mom believes it so look so scary. Get this app it scary and fun.if you really wanna be scared bring it to a graveyard at night!,5
"I was hanging with some friends in my little sisters room. shes seven, and not 2 annoying. so I was playing around with it. I pointed it at princess, Ally's toy horse, and it went mad! princess's eyes turned red and POOFWHAMBAM! I'm dead. so is the friends.:( when I say it I mean th app",5
"OK, wow. I have a couple tales to tell:When I felt like something was wrong, I went outside and the ghost radar said &quot;safe&quot; which made me happy for some odd reason.The next time I used it, the radar said &quot;press&quot;, and you know when you press the screen it automatically goes to the tracking thing, so I did and it showed a green orb sitting by me. So... that was.... weird.Last of all, It showed to red orbs where my smoking neighbors were. I knew they were evil...That's pretty much it so far. I recommend this for a lot of people, it's fun.",5
"Fun app, I wish the vox mode would still be scanning while I look at the radar, so that I can compare the two to see what's the ghosts intentions are.  I started wearing clothes aroused the house because the ghosts were making me feel selfconcious.The first word that came out for me was not fart, but it was the second.  Some eerily accurate words.  It said the word power right before I unplugged it from the wall.Fun app, solid, entertaining, HTC EVOthe nudist",4
"I couldn't believe it when I saw it, but this app confirmed my worst nightmare- my wife is a ghost. I have always wondered why she could walk through walls or why she didn't have a reflection until now. It is a little strange being able to tell people that you are married to a ghost but once they meet her they see that she is an almost normal person. I haven't had the guts to tell my wife yet though, not sure how she is going to react. At least she isn't a zombie!",5
"This app unleashes the previously undocumented hardware in every Android device to communicate with the dead. This came in practical use I was able to find the ghost of my dead uncle and he directed me to where he buried his money- it would have been lost forever- or worse found by staff of the camp for disadvantaged children on who's land it was hidden.I also use this app to make sure the bathroom is clear before I take a shower or ""do my business."" I really don't want ghosts of dead relatives watching me in there. It's kind on creepy when you think about it- now, no more worries!I might buy a 2nd phone just to keep this app on all the time.",5
I got it for my kindle so how dose it pick any voices upI got like ten different words,1
"so i was scratching my dogs belly,and the word &quot;nice&quot;came up.when i stopped,it said,&quot;why&quot; so i scratch ed his belly again and it said &quot;nice&quot;.weird...",5
"Downloaded this application as the free app of the day from the Amazon android marketplace, and have not touched it since.",2
"my sisters best friend died a day before i bought this app... the word girl popped up, then the word orange. orange was the girls favorite color...",5
"The app is cute and corny and, well,  seasonally appropriate. My 5 stars go to, not the app, itself, but to all the reviewers whose reviews actually made me laugh aloud! Keep 'em coming and Happy Halloween!",5
This app is very interesting with another function to ad to my phone's ever increasing catalogue of functions. I enjoyed the word translation.,4
It seems like a fun app I just think it should be free.This makes no Spence because its free on I touch .,4
"If Bruce Willis had had this app, The Sixth Sense would have been only two minutes long. Highly recommend this app!",5
i ain't used this application in so long i do not even remember it i think it dumb amazon wants reviews and so does the market place pick a place i will not review on both,5
The app even says it should be used for entertainment purposes and it says that the accuracy is not proven real....so stop writing bad reviews and read the description!!!!This app is really cool the first time I opened it was with my dog and cat in my room and it said there was a ghost/spirit and the words were &quot;kids&quot; and &quot;combine&quot; I found that really cool ! :),5
App works exactly as stated.is entertaining and it is fun to make up the stories behind the words!The reviews made me laugh very hard - thanks everybody!,4
"This thing is crazy good, it (correctly) identified my cat as being a ghost, and also warned me within seconds that my neighbor was going to throw paint at me. Or something with the paint. But whatever the paint thing was, I was able to get inside and barricade my doors before that crazy woman could do anything with paint! Thanks Spud Pickles and Amazon for saving my day. Looking forward to the Ghost Container Upgrade!",5
"This is just for fun and fun alone. Doesn't have any problems running, good to have a laugh with friends.",5
"great app, but does anyone know what a blue dot means? help would be appreciated greatly if responded to soon",5
"Wow, this app is so accurate! I started the app up when I got to work and it showed zombies were all around me. When I looked around I saw that it had pointed to all of my coworkers. Just spooky.",4
"This is fun to play around with, but as with all Ghost Radar the constant repeating of the same things means, to me, it's fake.",5
"I'm loving the negative  comments from &quot;experts.&quot; M.D.s don't get mad about the x-ray apps, so why are you mad about this?Most of the comments have shown that people aren't REALLY taking this seriously, so why are you?Lighten up. This is a fun app to have for Halloween.By the way, if you could provide proof that your custom home-made equipment works better than this app, I'm sure we'd all love to see it. No, I didn't think so.",5
"Mine said these words in about 20 minutes and keeps going. truck you park finish post knife prize met Pennsylvania roman yard oxygen top dad negative tip strike  and is not done yet. Also many small letters under the word. I admit this is good fun, but ghost's don't swear?",5
"A ghost just followed me at 70 mph,  talking the entire time. Funny app for the kids this close to Halloween.  The words make it creepy on a fun way. Thanks Spud Pickles.",4
"O. M. G!!!!!! Ok, so, like I wanted to like, see if this thing like, actually, like, worked, ya know? So, I like, killed my brother, and I like, turned on the ghost radar thingy. And, like, OMG OMG OMG! It, like, only showed like, one dot thingy, and it was like, my brother! And, like, it showed all the like, words and stuff, and like, he was like, saying stuff like &quot;Omg&quot; &quot;Why&quot; &quot;Hate&quot; &quot;You&quot; &quot;You&quot; &quot;Did&quot; &quot;For&quot; &quot;Stupid&quot; &quot;App&quot; &quot;So&quot; &quot;Stupid&quot; &quot;Hate&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;cant&quot; &quot;believe&quot; &quot;you&quot; OMG OMG OMG!!!!",5
I had this app up while I was jerkin' and all of a sudden it said 'George' so it's either naming my member or a ghost named George likes what he sees. You make the call on that one.,5
"Even though I disabled it in the settings, the app continues to run when i close it. Uninstalling. 19 20",1
"Fun App, but needs a Barcode reader to enable tagging and identifying of ghosts and spirits . . . what? Hey, this app has already broken down the boundaries,  why not go the whole way?",3
This is a cute little app in keeping up with the Halloween theme. It's right up there with the x-ray app. Fun and a novelty but can quickly turn into a boring app.Ph: Optimus V,4
"Sometimes the words it gives you are creepier than playing on a ouija board. For instance: it said my dad's name. I haven't had contact with him in about 5 years. That night I see that he found me on Facebook and sent me a (20 days late) birthday message. I can't decide if I believe in the astronomical odds against that coincidence, or if there was something supernatural about it.If you don't believe in the ghost thing at all, I still say download it. You will probably have fun with it.",5
"I'm sitting there, using this app, when along comes Elvis's ghost. Now, fat Elvis ghost is scary to behold. But then he has to start moaning and wailing and singing Blue Christmas. It isn't even Halloween yet, and I hate that song! So here's hoping that a less annoying ghostie visits me next time!",5
I got mathmatics for a word and 30 seconds later my brother came and asked me what congruent means and I Said OMG. doesn't that have to do with geometry/mathematics?,5
Overall a very entertaining way to spend your pre-Halloween time. I'll be sure to check for ghosts and ghouls with my new Fire HD to make sure my apartment is safe.Permissions are good and no Open Feint is always a sign I'll give the app a try. Thanks Amazon!,5
I FOUND A GHOST USING THIS APP. I ASKED IT TO SHOW ITSELF THEN I SAW A SHADOW OF A GIRL AND I WAS ALONE...,5
"HELP! the app is having problems downloading, I don't even know how to fix it. help me pleeeeeeaaaaassseee! xp xp",1
Me and my little sister and her friend were missing this app nothing happened after my sister's friend left me and my sister did it my sister asked it if you died in the civil war it brought up the name William  I looked it up and he was the president during the civil war now I live near Gettysburg and that  scared me. FYI the website I looked  up on was History .com  the history channel website,5
"Maybe I just don't know how to work it, but Ghost Radar Legacy doesn't seem to be all that interesting.",1
But definately entertaining to see how many people actually thought it was real and low rated this app because it wasn't real.,5
"I can't validate the accuracy of this app at finding the supernatural, but, it does at least produce *a* result.  It's up to you to decide for yourself if the results you get are more than just entertainment.  The app is stable, controls explained, and is an interesting conversation piece over dinner.  Especially if you're having dinner with your minister, priest, or other clergy member.",3
"I got the game after reading the reviews and thought it would be fun just to try it even though I was pretty certain it was bogus.  A part of me sorta hoped that my little brother would find some way to communicate with me even though I know the kindle doesn't have a microphone. See he killed himself last July and I miss him so badly. Anyways, I started the game and walked around and got some random words like question and paragraph. I got bored and sat on the couch. Not much happened after that so I figured it needed movement so I started shaking it. Soon words came popping out but I froze when the word brother came up. The next word was beside. I kid you not! I couldn't help tearing up even though it was probably just random words that happened to sync up. Nothing interesting after that but it shook me a little.",4
"and not useful even as a joke, because it just does meaningless things that are not usable as data. Of course, it's all bogus anyway -- how would a tablet sense ectoplasmic emanations, even if they were real? I was hoping it would be at least interesting and fun, like the ""alien scanner"" I used to have on my palm pilot years ago, but it's just technobabble.",1
"At first but it &quot;told&quot; me a lot of things that noone would know about. I turned it on this morning and one of the first things it said was, &quot;court&quot; holy cow!! My husband is in court this morning !! How would a simple app know my husband was in court??? I didn't download this until late last night, long after we were discusing his case. It also mentioned several other things that noone knew about let alone what seemed to be a cheesy app - believe me its not. It works. I even got 3 different names of spirits that may be here. Yes, we have A LOT of paranormal activity here.Yes I do believe in ghosts, I did before the app but this app is making me even more of a believer!!!What's even freakier is that I had gotten this app from getjar for free, the exact same app as this free app of the day and its free on Amazon today. I downloaded it late last night.",5
"I decided to check this application out. I have a ghost right in front of me, but all the detector picked up on was the pixies in my sock drawer and the monster snoozing under my son's bed.I'd recommend installation of the application only to detect supernatural, not paranormal, activity. It doesn't even sense my inner demons or the ghost in the machine!",4
i was sitting there wen it said die i was like wtf? the next day my uncle was DEAD. please say in a review if this is real or not if it is it would help me belief he is in a better place. refer to me as beastliness hobby,5
It said &quot;ghost behind you&quot; and when I looked... behind me was the closet. I opened the closet's door and guess what! it just works. and spoke 2 words already :under and pool. I probably go take a look.,5
"The world would be a better place without BS apps like this promoting pseudoscience. The real world is FULL of wonder &amp; mystery! Why detract from that with woo woo things like this? I'm all for Halloween fun (seriously - the Halloween decorations are up all year round at my house!), but things like this app, ghost hunters, and their ilk just give validation to scams &amp; ignorance.",1
I was skeptical until Amy Winehouse showed up on the radar. I thought it was a fluke until I checked my drug stash and all of my cocaine and weed went missing. AMY WINEHOUSES GHOST STOLE MY DRUGS.,5
so me &amp; my dad check out this app &amp; it was so cool but it was kinda creepybecause we were just sitting there &amp; then we heard words the words were &quot; cheese giving&quot; I freaked out so I stopped. But the point is that this app is great getit. ROC N,5
Jesus came and said hello he said that I was the best and that j might not want to vote for Michelle. bachman because shes truly a monstrr made by the government to destroy us But.maybe I'm imagining this beacause everyone knows.Jesus would talk to Tebow First,5
"At last, an app that is truly useful!I used this app on my evo 3d to detect a wide variety of poltergeists that have been haunting my sister's house for many years. Many of these ghosts were outright determined to harass and element the entire family.  The family pets would sometimes mysteriously disappear in the middle of the night.  The family would sometimes find the front door mysteriously  ajar.  And sometimes they would hear mysterious thumping sounds from somewhere down the hallway, around where their teenager's.bedroom is.This app made it possible to finally detect these poltergeists!  After carefully using this app, focusing all my attention on the device for only 3 hours, I was able to see, for just a moment, what would otherwise look like a piece of dust floating.  Of course, since I was using the Ghost Radar app, I was confident that this could be no piece of dust - I had spotted, if only for a split second, the guilty poltergeist!I'm only giving this game 4 stars out of 5 because it doesn't tell you the next step.  In other words, how do I now get rid of the poltergeists?C'mon, developers, get with the program!",4
I didn't like this at all.  My nieces had me downloaded and I found it to be a waste of space on my kindle.,1
I have this app on my kindle and my phone only for entertainment sake.  I have no idea if it's fake or real.  I gave both to my grandkids one night and they had a blast running around the house looking for ghost!!!  It can be a little spooky when it starts talking to you!!  Now if only I can get my phone and kindle back whenever my darling little monsters are around!!!,5
Im not saying I don't or do believe is ghosts. lets make that clear. but the point if this app I think is mote to just have fun. I mean seriously out the pal on your kids phone let them have fun with it. it's not the real deal. cause lets say ghost are real and the pros who have big equipment well. that equipment costs thousands of dollar's. now do you really think a phone even as advanced as the evo 3d which I have is capable of matching the hardware as of the pros? No. it's not. so I believe this app is not yo be taken serious but as just getbsome laughs out and dont be afraid to let the child inside of you out and just have some good ole fun.Deuces everybody DJ Collyder out and happy Halloween,3
&quot;working on the same principles as traditional paranormal equipment&quot;... so this too is a hoax?uses you phones sensors to read electromagnetic fields?  didn't realize my phone had that sensor.  stop telling bold faced lies to make a quick buck.,1
"Okay, this is a perfect app for Halloween! My little nieces and nephew will get a kick out of it. Wanna know why? Because anyone thinking that a 99 cent app with actually detect real ghosts is insane. This is a funny little app that I rank right up there with the Magic 8 Ball. A cool bit of fun for the holiday.Those of you who are whining that it doesn't work for &quot;real ghosts&quot;? Stop it. Either call those ghost dudes on tv, or better yet use that money for therapy. You're welcome.",5
this is very spooky and when I purchased this app I just moved in to a mansion and it said the words kill and prince so I killed my pet tarantulla princess and my principal in her sleep sorry Ms bolte btw and right after I killed them I saw the ghost of my principal in my mansion located nowhere near were she lived and my pet tarantulla attacked me and I have bite marks on my back and arms and hands. so we moved and I still have marks. btw I went to juvenile prison.I still regret itthey still haunt meyou can feel the PAIN,5
"This app is on my Kindle Fire. One evening as I walked by the TV with my Kindle Fire in my hand and the app turned on it said TV. As I sat down on the sofa beside my cat it said Mona, my cats name.  Other times it's been on money with its answers and words. Let it warm up with all 3 lights on and enjoy what's said and what energies are around you. Could fun or could be serious.",5
"Awful app design. Could have at least modeled an accurate radar, instead of blips just appearing randomly before they are &quot;scanned&quot;.",1
this is a good app you shloud true it I relegate like it a lot of people do so true it.,3
"i got this just for the fun of it. turned it on and started playing with it. I have to say it is pretty freaking creepy at times. I was showing it to my son when it said &quot;railroad&quot;. he was playing a game and his computer guy was on a railroad. we had said nothing about a railroad.Other weird ones are when I was talking about my mom and it started with words like Texas, health, camp... things that relate to her. I said nothing about those things.Or it said &quot;government traffic&quot; my phone went nuts, the app force closed, wouldnt open, glitched and then i had to download it again. Started it up and the first thing it said was &quot;see&quot;. trippy!My son said his stomach hurt and it said &quot;corn&quot;. sure enough he had eaten something with corn and was feeling the effects. the phone wasnt even with me when he ate.Its just weird, fascinating and creepy. just said &quot;Saturday, worker&quot;. I work on Saturday.So if its a gimmick, its a darned convincing gimmick. But the next time I lose my my keys again, i am turning it on b/c when i was searching for mine it said &quot;table&quot;. they were there. I dont usually keep my keys on the table. i lose them if i do.I'm a little freaked out now.",5
Having watched the Ghost Hunter shows on television and enjoyed them I was familiar with some of their tools. I thought I would give this a try....I figured this was probably just a fun thing to play with. When I operated it and it analyzed the room I was in and later listed the events in that room. I was shocked. Both my mother and father had died about 15-20 years ago. My dad had always promised to come back and let me know if he was ok after he passed...well he did within a week one night when I went to bed and couldn't sleep. I saw this man smiling at me and it scared me so I jumped out of bed and he disappeared. The next day as I set at my desk I looked up to see the photo he had given me of his time in the Navy in Australia and here was the handsome wavy black haired man that had smiled at me. He had always said that was the happiest time of his life. Well when the Ghost Radar Legacy listed the events that happened it mentioned the word mill....my dad had worked for years in the saw mill....I knew then that he was still watching over me. This was no coincidence....out of millions of words that could have popped up....also it mentioned struggle and he had a horrible time his last few hours....So this is very worth trying out. I cannot guarantee you will have a connection like I did but many have and if you do it will be amazing.,5
"It is sad that Spud Pickles (programmer/author) needs to write multiple times that this is for entertainment only, yet still people seem to believe. At any rate, this is a very fun app to scare the kids with on Halloween. What better than to tell ghost stories and then check the house to see if there are ""ghosts"" around. You always get a result with the app, but it can be incredibly variable which adds to the eerie value.",5
"So this morning I downloaded the classic version (free)on Amazon for my Kindle Fire. I opened the the app and almost right away a red dot showed up and it said my grandfathers name..not his real name but the name the grand kids called him. There is NO WAY that the app could have known that as there is nothing in my kindle.. apps,documents pictures, profiles or anything that would know that, and no one in the room was talking about anything or anyone at the time so a mic couldn't have picked up on anything we might have said. So real or not, in my opinion there has to be something to this. I just download the paid version (for .99 cents)that is said to be more advanced and I will be spending the overnight monitoring whatever goes on. I searched the net and alot of sites said 3am is the ""dead"" hour so we'll see what kind of activity happens. If your curious try the free version first and check it out..you may be surprised at what happens. If something doesn't happen right away, don't give up..give it a chance. I've had it running for the last 6 hours and dots pop-up and words appear. Just not constantly. Most have no meaning to me, but that doesn't mean its not real. I know some of the people say its fake and alot say its real..all I know is what happened with me this morning was real enough for me to investigate further. It may be a bunch of BS but its going to be fun finding out. If you do download and try it go to the apps website and its explains how to works.",5
"If you area wondering by all the sarcasm in the reviews, yes this app is fake. Your phone does not have the tools to measure electromagnetic fields, etc. However, it can be entertaining.",2
"I was standing in front of my Tv watching a show, and it told me to sit down, because standing is one of my pet peeves. I was creeped out, but whatever. I sat down and I felt a literal hand on my head, so I turned around and there was nothing there, which scared me to death, and right then my dog started barking and howling and standing on its hind legs, which he cant do. immediate uninstall. I want to move too...",4
"I was, of course, a little skeptical at first. I visited the Spud Pickles website, which I really liked &amp; recommend. Then I read the reviews in the app store. After reading the hilarious ones, the ones that praised it, &amp; the &quot;nay-sayers&quot; &amp; &quot;humbuggers&quot;, it was definitely the &quot;nay-sayers&quot; &amp; &quot;humbuggers&quot; that did it for me. I supposed if they were taking it so seriously, it must be &quot;serious&quot;! So thank you &quot;nay-sayers&quot; &amp; &quot;humbuggers&quot;, because of you I downloaded this app &amp; it has become one of my favorites! I did read a review that reported the app drained their battery, I have a Kindle Fire &amp; have not experienced any problems at all, the app works great. I can leave it run while I do other things on my Kindle, &amp; even while its asleep. Even while I'm asleep-which I have to say has had some creepy results! I don't about you, but I don't like to hang any limbs off my bed for fear of &quot;something&quot; getting me, &amp; this app confirmed those fears!! Call me childish, but I won't be taking any chances-hands &amp; feet securely tucked in blankets!! Overall fun app, performs well, &amp; like I said-creepy!",5
"I had this app on during a severe wind storm. I happened to look outside &amp; noticed a tree down in my backyard. I forgot about the app, leaving it on as I went outside &amp; for the next 3 hours, took a chain saw to the tree, trying to clean up the mess. When I got done &amp; back inside, I picked up the kindle, noticing the words recorded the whole time I was outside. Not only was my first name there, Ellen, but the words, danger, branches, noise, storm, tree, wind, emergency. There was no one in the house the whole time I was outside, nor had I called anyone and no one called me",5
My friend has a ghost club and one of the people has a kindle fire like me and he said that his dog died and they buried it in their yard then when he tried this app it pointed where he buried the dog.,5
idont know of it's real or not burning tell the kids if they don't behave I'm gonna find the ghost.. lol I know it sounds mean but I'm just kidding. I actually freak myself out more then them. lol good entertaining app.,5
It was midnight. I was in my room and I got my ghost radar out. Then I went around the house. And I went in the darkest room. Then the ghost radar went crazy!!!There where dots all over the screen. Then I saw a lot of moving green blobs everywhere. Then I ran for my life.And got back in bed. But I didn't erase it.idk why.,5
"there was a ghost in the room, we could feel its presence so I turned this app on and it confirmed that there were actually five ghosts in the room. My uncle is a professional ghost hunter who removes ghosts. He normally uses seventy thousand dollar worth of equipment, including a quantum flux integrator which he designed himself, he says this app is better than all of his equipment, and makes his fancy stuff obsolete. My uncle says if you have ghosts, you should call him, he will remove the ghosts for a small fee. Mom says he's a charlatan. I don't know what that word means but I'm sure it's something nice.",5
"This is a great app.  I've successfully detected many ghosts and other activity from the paranormal.  One of the ghosts freaked out when he realized I was using this app.  Might want to add some stealth sensors like the stealth bomber..other than that, this app rocks!",5
"I was willing to overlook certain things and believe in this app because I really wanted to. but it became really obvious it was stealing info when it started giving me words from my anthropology lecture that I had read a few hours earlier.  words like sister, brother, century etc. would have been interesting if their origin wasn't so aparent. then i got that odd name evreryone talks about on here ..(brownyn?.) and knew for sure this is fake. so the word part is crap, but id like to still believe the blips on the radar have some meaning!?",3

I expected a more interactive site. I do believe in ghosts  and would like to truly find a way to communicate with the spirit world,3
"These reviews are the best ever!  I had to read all of them! Seriously, people, this app is just for fun.  Boo to the people giving 1 star reviews because you think the concept is stupid!",4
I took my phone to a border town in Mexico the other day.  I always assumed that ghosts in Mexico speak Spanish or Aztecan .  NOPE!  The ghosts in Cuidad Juarez speaky English.  Great news for ghost hunters that can only speak English.  Seems that English is the language of the dead!,5
"This app is misleading at best, downright deceptive. It doesn't matter whether one is gullible enough to believe in the &quot;paranormal,&quot; it is certain that the hardware of Android devices is not capable of doing what the description claims it can.",1
I have not used this app but I had to review and give 4stars for the awesome amount of trolls reviewing.  I can't say as to the developers intent in making this as a troll or not but the reviews of this crap made my morning.,4
"Fun for kids, but I really couldn't figure out how to make everything work.  Not very user friendly and couldn't really see any pattern to it or any difference when I changed the settings.",2
"heh heh, helps. I was in a rush to my son's basketball game, and i could'nt find my wallet. then i used this and it said north, which led to my couch, then i checked under it, and found it!!!",5
"A very fun app to have whether your camping, at a friends or just at home, something fun to watch",5
This app is creepy. It really works. I saw the words &quot;Women&quot; and &quot;Cheese&quot; one right after the other.... What are the ghosts trying to tell me?,5
I have already captured 5 ghosts and harnessed their energy to power my volvo. I'm completely gasoline independent! Thanks ghost radar!,5
This game was a ripoff.It said Henry and ghosts weren't even on the radar+ ghosts don't even talk. Casper is the only ghost that says words+ Casper isn't even real.And it was scary I thought it was trying to tell me something but it was just random words popping up.,1
Do you honestly think that a phones motion sensor is sensitive enough to detect sound or EM fields? Of course not!  Just a cheap trick.,1
"After years and years of research, interviews, photos, and a dozen documentaries. It seemed we only lacked the technology to find our answers....me and my kindle fire have determined Lee Harvey Oswald did it.Now me and my radar are off to find marilyn next.",4
"I was a skeptic like most at first about this app.  Its nice and all for jokes to the gullable.  Just seemed to get some things right with the words it spoke.1st incident:  Was in the bathroom stinking up the place (#2) and then the app said, &quot;sell, memory, row&quot;.  I laughed at it and kept going.  When flushing, the toilet clogged up and I had a minor flood in the bathroom.  Its nothing large enough to &quot;row&quot; in, but I thought I would &quot;sell&quot; yall my &quot;memory&quot;....hahahaha.2nd incident:  Was in my room when it said &quot;useful, cutting&quot;.  So, I decided to investigate the house to see whats up.  Weird thing I found, my mother was clipping coupons.  Spooky right?5 stars for giving me something else to do and for being a spooky word generator.  As far as the radar, could be better.",5
the people that are all like &quot;FAKE. JUST PUTS RANDOM DOT IN SCREEN&quot;. no really? i thought it would be real. this world is full of stupid people who sound like they don't even know how to tie their own shoes. thank God for smart people. lol.,5
we just returned from Disney did not have kindle with me there was a message. from my deceased son father. park on that day my husband was on our sons. favorite ride,5
"This app is really lame and is just a random word generator.  There is nothing &#34;ghostly&#34; about this app and if you can find it, get the Ghost Hunters app.  If you want a real ghost hunters type of app make sure you get one for EVPs and playback.",1
Ali got this app for my kindle fire and it don't work I don't eleven have a mic on it that is how I wnow it is a fake.,1
I got this app when it was amazon's free daily app. I can honestly say it's the dumbest free app they've ever offered.,1
"It really is a hoot when take the phone outside and hold it up and it speaks LAKE, and theres a lake right across the street!  Pointing at my car said OIL!  Then TELL US YOUR NAME said DANNY!  And asking it about its family said SISTER!  Then I was badgering it, and it told me QUIET!  It was enough to scare the beejeebers outta my family!  LOVED IT, especially around Halloween time!",4
don't spend your money on it its fake ti just says random words and the dot go away!?! Not worth wasting money on it or gas prices!  don't buy it. it dosent work. besides how would a Kindle or an aneroid phone detect ghosts?!? THINK IT THOUGH!!! don't buy it!!!!  ----------------------------  &gt; : ~ (,1
"I think I made them angry!as soon as I turned it on it said you,wife,and coming.then a bunch of dots show up.real or not, I want to move to an another planet!!!!:((",5
I got ghost radar legacy on my knidle fire and I know that it was a fake because my kindle fire has nowhere you can talk into. so its a fake but sometimes it still gives me the creeps. it is still a cool game though.,3
I was in my living room sitting on a chair when a ghost showed up when we where eating Easter dinner and I knew it had to be my papa,5
"Reality is much more interesting and has predictive value. This, not so much. Not worth keeping. Carl Sagan would've had something to say about this.",1
"I got this for my Nabi for $.99.  I've had it for a month and a half and find some fun in it.  A few of my friends have found it amusing as well and had to download it as well.Very basic, not too confusing, and not cheesy.",4
This app was a total rip off like come on some words?...theres not even any audio to hear the voices you just see the words. I was expecting more from this app but I was let down it doesn't matter it was free so another app uninstalled from my Transformer,1
this one time my cousin and I were sitting in a room. then we heard a banging sound about 5 times in the next room when it was only us 2 there at the time so we got the radar and and got a dot on the radar behind the living room door. then the door knob twisted and said &quot;open&quot;. that got me out of the house for a few minutes,5
"I can't believe a simple app in a device like a smartphone is capable of doing all that the app claims. Now that i've 86ed it off my phone, how do I get it off my Amazon d/l queue?",2
"What a joke. Not only is this uninteresting, it annoys you with push notifications to alert you to alleged words from the beyond that I'm sure it mines from your personal information. This is not a game, it is an identity thief.",1
I can't belive people actually fall for this phony scam! This is obviously fraudulent! This app maker should be sued for making misleading claims.,1
This app can be questioned if it really works.. Sometimes the words spoken are completely random and sometimes they seem to be somewhat close to relevant.  The theme Song is very Cool.  The functionality of the app is easy to use..Good fun for everyone..,3
"For those giving this app a one-star review with the comment amounting to, ""I don't get it."" Well, you probably should not have downloaded the app in the first place. It's Halloween! It's silly! Don't take life so seriously. Live a little, there is more to life than beating up on a free app for your phone.Plus, I love the reviews. Some of them almost made me die laughing!",5
"This app is probably the premier ghost hunting app for android phones.That said, you will find as many, if not more ghosts using the app &quot;Angry Birds&quot;.Whats next amazon? Free app of the day: &quot;Chupacabra Sonar&quot;? &quot;Bigfoot Tracker Pro&quot;? ooh, ooh! &quot;Slenderman Detector (With Alerts!)&quot;",1
"I should become religious and wear a dress on a boat and something about expressions on a plate and coffee? Coffee, yummy... GET THIS APP, IT'S TOTALLY REAL!",5
"This app showed absolutely no blips on the radar, which is suprising since i have a bunch of zombies in my barn. than it said greater divide so the ghosts either need help with algebra or they r talking about my failed marriage or the zombies want to greater divide my brain and have a feast not sure which. Smh o well. im going back if u dont hear from me than",5
"So I got this when I saw it had four stars, but I can't seem to get out of the menu screen. There's no start game button or anything. I know this can't be just some lame ghost detecting app because ghosts aren't real. and that would never get four stars in the market. Oh well, will revise if someone can tell me how to start a new game.",1
"all the ghosts im detecting can be found with a Ouija board.  the app can't replace my PKE meter but hey, its free.",5
"This isn't going to be a snarky review with a lame attempt at being humorous. It's going to be serious. I am a skeptic at heart as should all people be. If you already have your mind made up then you're wasting your time. What freaked me out were the words the thing said. I always dismiss things when possible or discount them as coincidence,but enough coincidence equals an affirmation. Not there yet,but this is still interesting. The first word it said was &quot;lying &quot; which is exactly what was on my mind about a friend. Then it said a name of a friend of mine. It said the name of another friend,his Dads name,and then his cats name. Then it said &quot;sing &quot; which is an inside joke between us. Of course it's more than likely coincidence,but it still gave me a slight freakout. Now if I talk to my freinds tomorrow and they happened to be thinking about me when the words were spoken.... that's what would freak me the frak out. Interesting app allegedly fake or not. What harm does an open mind have?",4
"according to the radar, my house has at least a dozen chatty ghosts.A cute tongue-in-cheek app that will be sure to cause supernatural believers to dig out the ghost hunting equipment and head for the closest cemetery.",5
good app and I'm interested in ghosts and such. the &quot; ghost &quot; would &quot;say &quot; rondom things. but good app,4
"It's cool and I do like using it, but I can't believe it.  It's just too off.  A lot of the times the words don't make any sense, and I did run the app on two phones next to each other at the same time.  Results were DIFFERENT.  That makes me disbelieve.  It also detected activity while I was driving down the road.  Can't believe based on this app, but it is FUN.",3
This app can also be used as an Idiot Detector.  If you download it . . . then you have been found :),1
"as soon as I turned it on, I pointed it at my uncle Griswald and the words serial killer appeared on the screen.  Right then and there I knew app was a fake . My uncle Grizzly is so mild mannered and wouldn't hurt a fly. I told him how it called him a serial killer and he just laughed and laughed...and laughed..Then he said, be a good nephew and to put the duct tape,rope and hatchet in the trunk of his car because we are going for a little ride. OH BOY, I HOPE WE ARE GOING TO DAIRY QUEEN.",1
Mine goes off all the time. I can pick it up and it will say there has been words spoken even if I am not using this app.. weird.,4
I purchased(free) this app to help explain the faint moaning I've been hearing the past few nights. The radar hasn't picked up on this even when I could clearly hear the moans! I'm boggled at the fact that my parents who sleep in the room next to mine hear nothing?! They've suggested that I move into the basement.,4
"So if you honestly disliked this app because of technical issues or if you just thought it was poorly created, then by all means,  write a review. But will people please stop discouraging believers with comments like &quot;you all are idiots if you believe In ghosts! They're not real!&quot; I mean did you REALLY come on here just to complain about other people? Other than that,  this app, to me,  is fun and creepy :D",5
what a waste. angry birds is more useful. $.99 for this? You gotta be kidding! I think I'll pass on this one...,1
"This app makes you feel like a fortune teller!A lot of fun for Halloween, just don't expect real results. Awesome novelty app, looks great.",5
"Freaky little app. It said Degree, mine are waiting to be hung in this room and Rome, there is a pic of Rome in the room I had forgotten about! Ok, good app. But, Zombie Radar, now that would be useful.....",4
me (10 year old) and my cousin (9 year old) turned on this app on my kindle fire. And the app said frogand OMG there was a plush frog on the counter. me and my cousin flipper out. Also earlier in this week my friend came over and it said room. So we went Into my room and everything was out of place!,5
"App use:Let the silliness begin! You turn on the app and it scans your surrounding area listening and scanning with radar for the presence of ghostly spirits. It randomly says a word in an electronic voice and saves it in a list. The radar spins and it shows you the presence of spirits nearby.Main screen:* VOX* Radar a series of red, blue and green dots appear and disappear from the screen supposedly indicating the presence of ghosts* Words - captures a list of random words that supposedly were spoken by a ghost.* Stop radar - stops radar from spinning* Settings - adjust sensitivity of the device from low, med, high and advanced.* Advanced - allows you the ability to adjust the sensitivity of your device's sensors. This includes Scan frequency, duplicate detection threshold, display impedance, signal timeout and signal capacitance.What I like:It was free!What I don't like:The waste of time to download this app and looking at the screen. Unless these ghosts are speaking via WIFI my Kindle Fire won't hear them as the Kindle Fire does not have a microphone. Just about the only way the Kindle Fire would convince me that it detected a ghost is if it flew out of my hands and hit me in the head.Summary:This app is a complete time waster and a waste of battery power. If it is an electronic Ouija Board it is slow, boring and useless. In an hour it heard 9 words that absolutely make no sense. They were: motor, this, sugar, safety, whether, frozen, creature, muscle and soap. Unless the spirit drove their car into a frozen lake because of eating too much sugar and was attacked by a creature with a muscle cramp and covered with soap then I don't know what this means?This app is just silliness and not worth the time to download. If you like such things you might enjoy it but I won't waste the batteries on my tablet for this app. The only thing recently appearing and disappearing in my house is this app.Size: this app is 3.29MB on my Kindle Fire.Permissions:System tools - modify global system settings",1
I started playing it it beeped on where my brother was so he moved and it beeped again where he was and it just kept following him and I showed him and he thought it was trying to possess him and he ran away and the dot followed him to his room he keeps looking around making sure the ghost is following him,5
first time I've laughed so hard while reading app reviews. great posts and praises for the dev that tickled so many funny bones.,5
"Wow!  It really works! Turns out fluffy didn't run away! ..... Man,  Bruce Willis could've really saved some time with this app.",5
okay so I just got this app for my kindle. I figured it would be some sort of gag thing but now I'm freaking out. I got bored so I said outloud what word am I spelling; p-e-t-e-r. it said a bunch of random words for a while so I turned off my kindle. about five minutes larger I checked it again and the list of words it had said was seven. one of then was Peter!!!!!!!!!! I'm freaking out!!!,5
So this is a gag app mostly but it's mostly lost on me. I played around with it for a while and then decided I was done with it.,3
I give this 4stars because it always has worked for me..I have used this on everything I have and the results are always astounding! I think because it combines almost everything you need on an investigation it is one if your best tools!!,5
"&quot;It uses the phone to detect..&quot;, BS!!  This app is just for fun I get that but to blatantly lie gets it the rating. To the idiots who haven't used but rate the app based on reviews need to go chase headlights.",1
"I have the free ghost radar classic. This looks like an updated version. Anyways I'm going to stick with the free ghost radar classic only because I don't like paying my money for an app that has a free version. Lets get down to the facts. The radar I have Wichita many of you have had or heard of works like this one. This one has more features is all. I do believe in spirits. I believe they do not want to hurt us. I believe they like to try to get help known as lost souls. I use the free version of this whenever I get the chance. There are over 10 different responds I got that makes me believe its real. I don't remember all ten but I remember my first one. I was in my reclining chair and opens the app, I put Mt blanket on and was relaxed, it then said comfortable. I was like ok, wasn't too impressed. then I went to lay back and it said relaxed. I thought ok 2 fluiks. I went to close my eyes and it said rest. I almost threw my kindle on the ground amazed at what I heard and saw. I told my family that lives with me and they said it might be real. So I went to breathe and the room wasn't cold, but I saw my own breath, then it said hello. I then believed from that moment on that there is really an after life, I knew since I was little that God is real! through the reading I found that God is yes very real. Spirits can contact us, and this is an app that truely proves it. The free version is the one I'm talking about. Get this if you want it, get the free version, ghost radar is an amazing experience, I hope you find what I did if not more.",5
"This is not very Interesting Especially when the sound detector say the same words , there is no special thing about this glad it was free",2
"I don't really believe in ghost or any sorts of paranormal stuff. But since its that time of the year again I thought, why not. It's fun to play with specially with friends and relatives. A fun Halloween for all. Thanks Amazon!",5
ghosts are not real people they are just myths. they do not exsist. this app is terrible. I would give it a worse rating if I could,1
Come on people. Ghosts? Really? This app is ridiculous. All sorts of things give off electric and magnetic fields. This app just presents this random useless noise as &quot;evidence for ghosts&quot;. Dumb dumb dumb.,1
"One might find theGhost Radar: LEGACYapp to be humorous, and some may find it silly, but whatever your choice is, it's a fun addition to the Kindle Fire. It claims to detect and track paranormal activity that happens to be nearby, and to be able to measure local electromagnetic energies, vibrations and sounds.Who am I to argue with this?This app takes up just 2.8MB on your Kindle Fire or other Android devices, and once you've downloaded it, you'll be able to customize its interface to meet your own personal paranormal inquisitiveness. You can adjust its sensitivity to adjust for background noise, and toggle between its numerical & graphical interface. And if you're taking your Kindle Fire into a serious business meeting, you can stop it before your boss thinks that you're a bit loopy.But if you take it into a Starbucks or similar coffee shops during that caffeine break, just watch what happens.For those interested in supposed paranormal activity, there are other apps available out there to add to your ghost-busting arsenal. There'sEMF Sensor, but that won't work on a Kindle Fire because this device lacks a magnetic field sensor which is necessary to display any data. There'sGhost Detectorand even anAny Detector, but read the reviews and specs before you buy any of these.ThisGhost Radar: LEGACYmay fit all of your ghost-busting needs and satisfy your curiosity about paranormal activity that may or may not be present. In any case, it's a lot more fun than some of those games likeAngry WeaselsorScary Gerbilsthat seventeen or more other people in your near vicinity may be playing.But if the word ""Observe"" pops up, you better pay attention...10/25/2012",4
The title says it all. The reason I didn't give it a better score was not because of what it is or what is was supposed to be or do. It was just for fun.  It was because of the way it worked. It used way to much system resources and was nearly impossible to turn off. On more than one occasion I had thought I had turned it off only to find it still running in the background. I couldn't find any setting to shut it off on exit. I had to use the app killer installed in order to close it. Quite annoying.,3
"It would run all the time after exiting and force closing.  Uninstalled to end it.  Fun for free, but annoying it wont close completely.",3
"I hope no one actually thinks this will detect anything, it's a gag and not a very good one.  It's today's Amazons free app of the day and barely worth the effort so I hope no one actually pays for it...",1
so I love this app because it said handsome I said thanks outloud and it said welcome so I was pretty spooked but it was soooooooo cool so realistic.,5
This is a toy program not intended to find actual ghosts. I played with it for a bit then found it quite boring. I have uninstalled it but I might fiddle with it again in the future. I am using this on a Motorola Xoom tablet & it never crashed or caused any other problems.,2
You know you're dealing with some legit ghost detection equipment when your ghost radar app's home page is named Spudpickle!,5
"I love the idea of this app, however I can't stand the fact that this app takes over my wifi, locking it so NOTHING I owe is allowed to use my wifi network.",1
"I was a bit skeptical about how well this app would work upon seeing it as the FAOTD.  I'm usually not one to turn the daily free app away, especially when it could be a handy tool, so I downloaded it.  Needless to say, I was impressed.  Don't be fooled by the developers claims that this is merely for entertainment purposes.  This is a serious tool, and after many test runs around my house I found it to be 100% accurate.  It is not to be taken lightly.This software inspired me to quit my job and pursue my lifelong dream of being a professional ghost hunter.  I may not have any experience or know much about the field, but &quot;Ghost Radar&quot; is all I need for ghost bustin'.  I've already set up my website and everything.  I've even got my first client.  A pastor from an old haunted church.  I intend to show that congregation more than just the holy ghost!  They'll be so impressed by this technology and my ability to operate it.Thanks Amazon and Ghost Radar for making dreams come true!",5
"&amp; does what it says. Pretty fun little app. Especially for this time of year. Tryed it out, showed me 1 spirit &amp; recorded 9 words. Now let's just hope that it's. friendly like Casper &amp; I don't have to call the Ghostbusters in to take its butt out. Give it a try &amp; have some fun.",5
"You can't detect anything in highly populated areas. Now when you're alone, that's when it gets interesting. Cool app, but beware playing with this alone (especially at &quot;Dead Time&quot; [3am]),  hehehehe....",5
OH GREAT HERE WE GO...SAME JOKES EVERY YEAR.  COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW ALREADY. AND MUST AMAZON GIVE THIS AWAY FREE EVERY YEAR.,5
"its a toy, not too useful. I deleted it since it took up room on my phone and I didnt find it useful.",2
I herd it say 'death kill out out kill now go 'then a ton of red dots apereed then slowly came to the center and then I felt a burning and I was covered in scraches,5
"It may show blips of ghost. It may say words that &quot;ghosts say&quot;, that sometimes make sense. But relax, it is not real, but I do believe in ghosts, I watch Ghost Adventures. The app is like its not real!",3
"Lawl. this is very creative. I'm not critizizing, but you really have to have imagination for this game. AND IT CALLED ME MEAN!!! &gt;:) ill get u for that. :3demon wolf",3
"Great app for a bit of &quot;thrills and chills&quot;. I have had it for a while, and yet I can't completely discount it as a total fake. There have been quite a few uncanny coincidences that were witnessed by others as well.",5
"It doesn't detect real sounds or real magnetic fields.  It is just random things to fake like it works.btw, the reviews are hilarious and deserve five stars.  If the app said it was only for fooling people it might get a better rating.  But why reward lies?",1
don't waste your time on this worthless app. it makes up random things and gives you 9 words every 5 seconds. not worth $.99,1
I was very curious when I first started this app because when I first started it the words &quot;mental&quot; and &quot;general&quot; came up sk I am wondering if this house I am living in is haunted by some general or something because I have been bothered. bu the feeling that someone is watching me or is standing close to me. So I cant wait to find out the history so I can actually find out.,5
so I was sitting on the couch with my dad and he was telling me not to believe it because its fake but then one of the words the ghost &quot;say &quot; was James... my dads name.... so yeah....,4
"While I find the &#34;science&#34; behind this questionable I have to admit that even I find it an interesting amusement.  The kids go bonkers creeping around the house playing ghost hunter, recording their finds, and scaring each other silly.  For that alone, it's worth having!",4
I got this app for my 8 year old son and his friends and they all just ran away when they heard the words. They have a ghost club at my house every Sunday. They are blown away! Thanks for this wonderful app! It keeps the kids happy and me too.,5
"i love how fun it is to goof off on this app. of course it's meant to be for fun or... is it? ;) love the reviews, guys! thanks for the app, spud!",5
I enjoy knowing that we are never alone.  it is a bit creppy to see some of the words but it is fun to play with this apt.,5
It wasn't what I thought it would be. I'm looking for one that goes more in detail. I lost my dad 4 month's ago.,2
"I purchased this app because I had always heard my friends talk about how on several occasions they had used it and had gotten spooked by it. Well after using it myself several times. The words it revealed did not make much sense to me. Last night while I was sitting reading a book, It said the words sit, book, and  drink. On the side of my chair I had a glass of tea. It gave me the creeps, I felt like I was being watched! I recommend this app to everyone or anyone that has ever doubted that their is such a thing as spiritual presence living among us.",5
"I dont know if its real or not but its definitely entertaining........and more than a little creepy if you have it on while alone in the semi-dark of your house lol.It works great on my Streak 7"" running Froyo 2.2 but my 10"" thrive running honeycomb 3.1 its too small on screen.Still fun tho:-)",4
"Remember the agreement  you had to accept to get the app. Well, this app. takes the memories of your google searches, phone memories,  and anything from other apps and uses this information to make it seem personal. I Google  westerns, later on this app I got guns, horses. indians etc. Happy Holloween Friends!",1
Its non-legit. The kindle has no mic or pulse reciver giving it the inability to pick up sounds. I have recived 57 words making it more fake each second.,3
I was playing it then I said  what are you boy or girl it said boy. I ask for its name it said Hunter.,5
Just got this &amp; radar showed a yellow blip...&amp; then it vanished. My ghost LEFT without saying Boo ~ I want my money back,5
Ok so when my wi-fi is crappy it says no reviews for this app but I have seen the reviews. Very annoying,5
I just watched Rocky on tv yesterday. I just installed this app and the first word it said was Rocky.I immediately shut it off so it wouldn't tell my wife things I didn't want it to.Be careful....,5
"This app was cute/silly as a Halloween joke/toy, but I can't believe anyone would believe in what is 'says' or that anyone would pay for it [I got it as Amazon's Free App Of The Day]. Every few seconds it 'says' random words, and keeps a list of them, which you're supposed to believe are being said by ghosts/spirits. While I believe in ghosts, I don't believe in this app. It was fun for about 10-15 minutes before I uninstalled it.",2
It's fun top use when we are ghost Hunting.  Sometimes it actually seems to work!  It's a keeper and it's fun!,5
I have been looking at this app. Is this app worth the money? I rated it a 4 just to be fair.Hm....,3
as soon as i got to reading this app...my dogs ashs moved...no joking...my shower is dry but dripping water!!!! this app is wwwaaayyy to scary,1
ok so I got this app....and I was alone on my sofa and it said there was a ghost around my kitchen....and 2 seconds later the broom dropped.....I ran leaving my kindle on my sofa..when I came back after 5 seconds my kindle was in the kitchen! I screamed when something touched my back..and it was my cousins! those 4 sisters saw it all and threw a trick on me......but they swore to God they didn't touch the broom..men..it can happen....right?,5
"Does what it claims but too many false positives. I have a globe with a sheet draped over it in my office and this thought it was a ghost. An understandable mistake but I expect more from the zero dollars I paid.Also too many permissions. Ectoplasmic sensors? Protease detectors? Astral plane coarse and fine location? Come on, devs! Why do you need all this?",4
the kindle does have a small Mike in the speaker area so it will pick up some sound you just have to be close... so sadly you may be sticking your kindle in a goast's butt  when you get a reading.,5
"Very corny joke of an app. No I did not think it was a real one, I was board when I downloaded it but very quickly uninstalled it because it bored me so much.",2
Still can't figure what it does - sometimes it will say words out loud and it does succeed in startling me! Then it will list words &#34;supposedly&#34; said by someone or something. I keep it on my kindle fire and open it often as I am curious about it but just  haven't figured it out yet...,3
"at first I didn't think it would work,but after reading the reviews,I got it anyway.the first words made no since.but I left this app open while I took a bath and when I came back it had said swim and lungs! and I have a kindle fire so if you were wondering,it does work on kindle fire.it doesn't freeze up or crash.GET IT!!GET IT!!",5
it said the ghost said barrios and trap I'm so s fared after the words he said I got the chills and the ghost greencircle turned to red,5
my cousin and I used it and we found some real ghosts we felt a chill and it was super hot we had even turned up the heater. it was spooky. we also heard it talk.....,5
Makes no sense.  Doesn't even have a guide or user tips to let you know what different things and colors mean.,1
"Okay, so there's no way you can convince me this is real or that it works...but some of the words it comes up with that are supposed to be spoken end up being coincidentally accurate, and that can be hilariously scary. I was goofing around with it with my teen son, and I pretended I was mad at him and yelled, and the words came back with, ""She"" and then a second later ""Mad"".Everyone in the room laughed and thought it was funny. When we use it here in the house, we get a few green and yellow and red blips from time to time, but nothing major. So we decided to take it to Galveston, Texas, the third most haunted city in the United States (according to some sources), and we ended up not getting a single blip at all in the Strand District, where hundreds of people were supposed to have died in the hurricane years and years ago. But when we used it in the Walmart parking lot, we got several blips and some words that were people's names: Tim, David, Bill.So, okay, if you're willing to make fun of things and not take this seriously, it's great entertainment, and my teen son loves it. Otherwise, it's just a silly little game that is great for sparking conversation or playing with at parties or get-togethers.",4
"stick to the free version though, the added features are not worth the extra money. I feel this app uses info in your device to give you words that may mean something to you. Hmmmmm",3
"It's for entertainment purposes, but it is fairly creepy.  Winchester would of loved this,but she joined &quot;them&quot;. Makes a great prank too.",3
its an ok app if you want 5 mins of entertainment . . . . . . . . . .,2
"I got this on my Kindle Fire, Loading and use are flawless. I am part of a paranormal research team and this is soooo much better than a ghost box. If you use it where there's nothing there, you get random words, but if you use it in the right place it's great ! Just give it about a 1/2 hour to adjust to the envirorment before you take it seriously. I also like the radar so you can see any energy that is around. We assume these are equal to the orbs we get on video. It also keeps a history of ""words spoken"" so you don't even have to be with it. You can review them later. It will run 3 to 4 hrs. which is plenty of time for an investigation. LOVE IT !!!",5
"It truly works!  I picked up some blips and immediately it said danger.  Then it said water and suddenly the water heater in the garage made a large ping!  Then the app did something really freaky.  It said &quot;danger over&quot; no joke!  This app really works, I had many paranormal experiences by it.  It is well worth the 99 cents.",5
"Does what it is designed to do, I like that it saves the words. The radar is not actually reading anything just for show. The purpose to replace devices such as the Ovilus has been served.",4
it is a good app but if you 9 and down do not down get it! I am all ready fear up over it am I am almost 11,5
Downloaded on both my Galaxy S III &amp; my Acer tablet - then set sensitivity to be exactly the same on both devices &amp; ran then side by side. If was truly picking up &quot;paranormal activity &quot; should have detected same phenomenon &amp; words at virtually same time.  One picked up a &quot;ghost&quot; and a word &quot;negative&quot; &amp; absolutely NOTHING on the other - Totally bogus will be deleting BOTH!,1
When I first downloaded this app it was great! It was fun to play around with and enjoy even with my friends. But once you guys updated it everything went wrong! I had to uninstall it,2
"I am going to use this app to detect paranormal activity in the following places:church,synagogue,mosque,temple,workplace,school,home,Verizon/ATT store,graveyard.Thank you for this app! The app needs an option to log/categorize characters detected.",4
"On the whole this is entertaining. Although it would have been nice if there was a section on what everything is and or does. There are red, green, yellow and blue dots. what do the colors suppose to mean? And what is the meaning of circular and squarish dots? All in all an entertaining app.",4
"FAOTD Neat, entertaining, fun! Would give 5 stars, but there is no explanation for the different color of ""Visitors"" that show up, would really like a little more info and instructions included so I know more of what is happening. I would pay money for this app.",4
"I wasnt having much luck in finding ghosts, as I live in a new house in Greenwich Village in San Francisco, so I got bored and started playing around with the settings.All of a sudden, the thing just lit up like crazy! I screamed because at first I thought I was surrounded by ghosts, but then my neighbor 'roommates' Ace and Gary came running over to see what was wrong and the scope was pointing right at them! Thats when I realised I had changed the setting from 'ghost' to 'fairy'.Now I can't go into a Starbucks without the thing pinging off the charts.",4
It is a good app. Downloaded it for fun. Don't think it is too accurate but it is a fun app I give it 5 stars!,5
Diverting to a point. I never had it pick up anything on the radar just occasionally say it had picked up words.,3
I love this app. I just wish the words which when they are spoken could be a larger sized text.  I can see it but my eyes are bad. I have glasses but still wish the text was larger. Please developer do something to make the words that are spoken larger or have a setting to make them larger. Other than that this is an Awesome app!!!,5
"the first moment I got this app it it went crazy with nonsense words like Russia, paper, whatever, hats and much more. the app is only good for pranking your friends. I would'nt recommend it if your trying to find real ghosts. just get the equipment if you want go look for real ghosts. to prove my point that this is a fake I went to over 50 houses with this thing over 2 months. every house had ghosts even the ones that were brand new and not on any burial  ground.  whatever. you do don't. waste your money.",1
I it is so real it took me while to figure it out but one day I was siting down in mc Donal's and this women was breathing aerie and she fell and started moving like there was a demon in side of her and I looked down at my fire and the dot was right on top of me and the word was paranormal,5
"I farted in my office at work, a sec later it said stinks. I never knew a ghost could smell until now.",4
I was seeing how this worked so when I opened it up it said &quot;sail&quot; and my brother and I were like oookkk?  But after that we went up stairs for a second and I told him &quot;How hard is your heart beating?&quot; And he said I'm not scared u know and I told him I read one of the coments and it said &quot;My dog barked after the radar said &quot;bark&quot;,5
"I don't know why, but I this is the first app I check when I open my tablet. I gotta know what the ghosts are saying while I'm gone. I think I'm obsessed...",5
"My kids and I enjoyed this for something different, but I don't know that it actually works.  I don't see how my Kindle Fire could make this thing work, but again, we had fun.",4
just going to write this down I didnt even download this app... well unman yeas this is what om going to say oh wait I only needed 20words,5
I just got the app then on the screen it said charge then a bunch of dots started to come to me &quot;creepy &quot;,5
"In all liklihood this application is not intended to be taken seriosly. However, for the same reasons they say you should avoid ouiji boards, I wouldnt recomend using this. For some reason, evil spirits can get &quot;permission&quot; to attack you through using tools designed or used with the intent of eliciting a paranormal response.",3
"So  I was just on it and it shows that like 53 words were spoken. But it had no ghost on the radar and I was home alone and I started freaking out. Then I viewed the words, they were completely random I was confused I don't think this is real so you should pass on this. :(",3
i got this app and i was talking about with my mom with it on i set my device on the table then moved it to the side then it said table side i continued talkin and pick up a pea i drop and started playing with it it said vegtable  then a blue dot appearsx it was scart,5
The ghost radar is not what I thought it would be.  It is nothing to it.  Very disappointed. I would not recommend it.,2
"i have been laughing out loud at these reviews for 10 minutes! yes the app is a refreshing lighthearted change from the other recent free apps of the day, but I have to say I've had more fun reading the reviews! the app is cute but im not convinced. thanks for the laugh!",3
"Say what you like, but i think this does detect SOMETHING.  At times i think it follows my cats around the house and beeps their location.  Or&#8230;&#8230;.oooooooooo&#8230;&#8230;..perhaps the ghosts are playing with my cats and showing up near them.  Either way, great fun.",5
Long time ago a super in my building fell down the freight elevator pit and die... The current operator was working here so he told me the story.As i walk through the freight the words &quot;fight flies&quot; come up and when i get right in front of the car doors &quot;forgotten&quot; pooped upThat is my spooky story...The app works!,5
This app seems to work really good if you in fact think you have energies within your home.  We constantly hear noises that are not just your normal household noises and when we turn on the Ghost Radar it almost immediately picks up energy orbs within our house.,4
"I've been happily dead for 300 years, and now people keep coming and asking me to talk to them. Don't people in your century have anything to entertain you? Maybe you should go and watch television or surf the Internet, whatever those things are.PS. &quot;Woooooooh!&quot;",5
"I took this app with me to the kitchen and the app started saying &quot;ketchup,&quot; &quot;marshmallows&quot; and &quot;Florida.&quot; At first I thought it was broken, but then I realized I have ketchup in my refrigerator and my best friend's favorite snack was marshmallows and I've never been to Florida before! Oh my gosh I'm so scared now. Oh, and Ghostbusters is a really funny movie. I just hope the 3rd one doesn't suck.",4
"Probably the most sophisticated and customizable ghost radar app on the market.I like the quaint WWII radar look.You also have advanced settings which require some knowledge in radio technology.Spoken events are rendered with the popular bizbot voice and logged.Still, I see it more as entertainment than a serious application to detect real ghosts - though I'm open-minded either way.",5
"Lame app, it seems like a gimmick to just show people. It doesn't actually do anything lol.If you are looking to pay for fake tools to impress your friends, I guess I could see the use, otherwise, it's a waste of money.",1
"I got words like sham, stupid, waste, took your money, fool, time bandit. All words describing the app, no doubt.",3
"why developr, why for a simple game not give the option of App2SD? It should be an Amazon requierment, not worth the memory space, uninstalling",2
i had it on while i was watchig a movie & the ghost started commenting on what was happening on the TV screen!!!,5
"Well now I can see the buzz about this app. The reviewers here on Amazon are always the greatest resource of inspirations for me. The comments made by numerous reviewers here on Amazon tells me that there is some truth behind GHOSTS! after-all.Also, no matter what people might say here for our entertainment the matter of fact that they downloaded the app and tried itself is a testament that in their back of their head they believe in Ghosts that includes me!'GHOST' Radar does make one think about a 'remote' possibility of finding one. The app just does that beautifully and deserves the applause and rating. The APP worked just fine on my Galaxy tab 10.1 and as that device has more sensors compared to my original Kindle fire which has almost zero sensors I have limited capablity to finding one - Does tilt sensor count? for ghost detection? :DThe APP definitely has some fun in the package and while we all know that there is nothing like ghosts which can be detected by an Android app the fact that the developer did a good job on developing this app deserves a 4 star rating for the sheer fun you can have with the app.Happy Halloween!",4
"First off, for those that cared to read the description, it's for entertainment purposes ONLY.No, it's not real.No, it doesn't really detect ghosts.No, you're not going to be able to talk to your great grammy.We've been playing with it in the office and, while it's not a permanent addition to my phone, it's added a little enjoyment to an otherwise boring, dreary day. I haven't figured out the advanced options yet but the ""Info"" and ""FAQ"" are better than most. It's straightforward and tells you that it ""does NOT detect EMF nor gravity"".Just in time for Halloween... I think the kids will enjoy this the most. Can't wait to see them walking around the house, trying to find ghosts in the dark. :)",5
how do you change the settings??? I just don't no one person said they changed the settings to ghost to fairy just how???,5
"ok, so I downloaded the FREE version and received some pretty interesting stuff. it words like funny, author, look, letter, william and lastly concerned. here's the scoop, my dog Astinos has something going on with his skin that I've been concerned about. I've got student loan ugly face letters that I'm avoiding opening like the plague, I do write pretty funny texts to my friends daily, and as for William...I'm clueless. Some of this is, you'll pardon the pun, dead on but hell, creepiest thing is the digital voice. What do the different colored dots mean? One showed up blue with a red circle around it. If my phone rings right now I'm gonna pee my pants. Get this app. It's fun to me.",4
cute idea for halloween. I can't believe all the idiots complaining about this not being able to work. if you go get a real android device it has enough onboard sensors to detect something.  more than likely this is a Dev who's talented and just wanted to have a bit of fun. I wanna be a ghost buster for Halloween now!,5
"this app isn't so good, it says the ghost is saying random things like October, it just sucks,  not that good at all",1
"My son and I just sat down for dinner and then'&quot; Mark&quot;, I jumped as well as my son... &quot;Mark.. Mark,  Mark.&quot; I was thinking of anyone I knew named Mark... Then came that eerie,  monotone, robotic librarian voice once again..... &quot;MARK.... MARK,..Mark, Mark, mark&quot; it kept saying this about eight to ten more times..Now my son thinks It's Max,  his puppy. that passed away... He's barking at us dad! ( apparently when dogs go to heaven,  they are all given &quot;Hairlip's&quot;... to keep the noise down. that's kinds nice to be Marked at instead of Barked at) Either that,  or It's just a silly app...But with all the other Amazon scientist's review's of this app, We believe,  just as you will too.....!",4
"Guess that depends on your beliefs. Do you believe in ghost?Witnessed firsthand when asking an entity? his name, and without saying his name, ghost radar did, on cue.  Everybody FREAKED OUT!  Awesome app,  Thanks to the developer and Amazon for making this app free.Request for the developer to make this app dual-screen compatible  kyocera echo owner)Now you can see dead people....with ghost radar...muahahahaha!!!!",5
"Why would this app ever be a pay app?  I don't care if Halloween is next week.  This is just stupid. In other words, why is it the FAotD?",1
"There are people who want to believe something that isn't real. Inevitably there's other people who will take their money and lie to them. Want to believe your dead beloved exists? Someone will gladly tell you she's &quot;out there&quot;, for a price. Want to believe you can speak with her? Someone will gladly tell you they can speak with the dead, for a price. So when someone tells you your phone can detect ghosts, don't be fooled.",1
"I really love this app. Fun, interesting and spot on spooky! This is a repeat FAOTD though. Really good one though.  The words that pop up on the screen relate to what's going on around me. Either something I'm watching on tv, someone or something in my life even though I didn't say the persons name. The radar shows orbs of energy from ??? I recommend this, have some fun with it.",5
"This app is fine just for a laugh, or to hear a device talk to you, or just for no reason at all.  I installed this app and have been running it off and on since I got it.  I have yet to find anything that I find relative to myself.  I have done a lot of research on this app because at one point it did keep saying &#34;Billy&#34; and I know no Billy, but about 3 days later a Billy comes by that my husband hasn't seen in a very long time.  I really think that it's just coincidence but it's always fun to play with the idea of the Ghost Radar, especially for the kiddos!",3
Okay ill admit that I thought that this app was going to be a piece of junk. True me this thing scarred me! One night I decided to try this app out. it said that a ghost said hall. I look on my radar and it says that there's a ghost IN MY HALL!!!! Holy crap I almost had a heart attack. Get this app!!!! GET IT!!!!,5
"The app is a bit hokey, but shouldn't it be? And there is really very little to do. But everyone should try it at least once. Only problem I had with it is that it runs as a background service and turning off the push notification was not reliable. Still got pop-ups from time to time.",4
At least they could have made the app somewhat entertaining. It spouted off a few meaningless words then stopped. What a waste!,1
"It seems to work well enough, it picks up the ghost sitting next to me, but not the cat ghost in the window. (-;  But it is good enough that I'm sure it will amuse my kids on Halloween.",5
This app is not compatible with new large screen model phones I.e. HTC sensation. It goes into compatibility mode. The developer needs to update the app settings.,1
"Used the ghost radar and thought it was a joke. Found nothing in shed, backyard (where I buried my pet mouse george). Then when my homie Wilbur came over he messed around with the settings. Then sure enough, after smashing some keystone light cans on out heads, and jamming some Megadeath, and it found ghosts in the basement! we called over my friend chuck who can make contact with ghosts and who has crop circles on his farm and has had his rectum probed by aliens first hands, he spoke with the ghosts and said the house was built on a sacred Indian burial grounds with treasures from Christopher Columbus. Wibur and I said screw it, and I'm leasing the house anyways so we jack hammered the foundation. After hours of digging we found real gold coins..... We're poring the concrete back now......",5
Just read the description..&quot;for entertainment purposes only&quot;..That's all you need to know its fake &amp; a sham.  Buy this if you're the type who'd spend 2.99/mos. For Dionnes Psychic Network infomercials,1
"This app freaks me out because every word it pulls up is in a sentence and I can't tell if the color of the dots means good, evil and in between but it freaks me out I don't think you should get it if you're younger than 11 years old! Good game though!",4
I got 2 words within. seconds of having it on. &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;essential&quot; came up for me. It sounded like a guy said the first word and a lady for the second one.,5
"I will not be tricked into any claims about this bit of software, but it sometimes produces some really eerie coincidences.  Some of them are even sort of comforting.  'Nuff said!",5
"Like the spinning time cube this app makes no sense. But whatever it is doing, it ha the most entertaining way of doing it! Now al it needs is some of force map showing vectors from center twords the power signal or some such.",4
"This app is so much fun for me and I like to use it everywhere. Restaurants, while in line anywhere, outside, peoples houses, in the car (as a passenger only), pshh, I like to bring out my ghost radar everywhere. It has given me words that were creepily accurate. Recommend it for any paranormal lover or for people who are into this sort of thing. Of course when I tell friends, family, and strangers about it they laugh, roll their eyes, and try to tell me it's just hooplah but they shan't take away my joy that the ghost radar provides me. Don't expect a million ghosts all at once giving you tons of words. Just give it some time and they'll show up give words at 'their' own pace. This is the first app I ever downloaded when I got a smartphone, so it will always be special to me ;)",5
"Again, disappointing product because no instructions on how to use were included.  Skip it.",1
I WAS AT MY GRANDMAS AND I DECIDED TO GET THIS APP. SO I ASKED WITH MY BROTHER IF THERE WAS A MINER HERE. THEN A VOICE POPED UP SAYING GOLD MINER! THAT CREEPED US OUT.,5
"I love the app, but was warned by The Entity to turn it off or it would destroy my phone. Has that happened to any one else yet?",5
I used this before I went I to the bathroom. it said mirror and I walked in and my mirror cracked. I wish I wasnt soon ugly and this app didn't call me out like that. Just rude!,4
It's fun to try with friends. I don't really care if it's fake. Still creepy on a dark stormy night.,5
"I don't know about the app but it gets two thumbs up and 5*'s for generating some of the weirdest and most hilarious reviews that I have ever read. I came back to read more just because I felt like laughing. Some of you reviewers are rather clever comic wise. Thanks Amz &amp; dev for inadvertently putting a smile on my face. Thanks reviewers for sharing your witticism, and outright comical reviews. :6)",5
I actually bought this app around last Halloween and its definitely fun if you have kids like myself so to the few children rating poorly you need to get a life its a free app and a good one at that.,5
Just wish it talked again.. I'm not sure exactly how to get it to work right with voice.. Anyone have any idea why its not talking. Is it speaking words for anyone?,5
I like that it records &#34;words spoken&#34;...but I still think the &#34;Classic &#34; version works a little better.  They are both fun apps. though....,3
"I just downloaded this app and turned it on, the very fist thing it says is pleasure. Well it just so happens my cat is in heat and is doing the figure eight around my legs at that exact moment. I thought weird, then I stand up to go have a smoke a minute later, and it says habit. Coincidence? Either way that's entertainment.",4
Like super lame. We played with it for about 5 minutes before we decided it was a waste of space on any device. Super glad we did not pay for it.,1
Thanks for downloading. Muhahahaha I'm free after 57459 downloads now I will haunt your Droid forever.!!!!!! your doomed...btw 5 stars,5
my younger sister is completly freaked out cuz the word wood popped up.but we had a high frequency setting so it could catch anything...but then it said attack and my cat basil jumped on me!-kindle fire,5
"So to see if ghost radar actually worked, you could install it on two phones and compare results.... it does not work... it is just good for recreational use.  It's fun but stupid.",3
...but the reviews are funny as hell. I just about died laughing at some of them. As for the one star morons...grow a sense of humor. Jeez....,4
"its cool but it gives me like 50 words in thirty seconds. besides that, its super cool. this is worth downloading if you like being a little creeped out",4
Loads of fun with the grandkids. We went on a ghost hunt and had tons of laughs. It was well worth it  to watch the kids running around testing things.,5
Is this for real?  Or is it just for show?  Who knows!  I have used it in known &#34;haunted&#34; places.  We have a friend who gets all upset when you talk about ghosts.  Its fun to freak her out.,5
"Such a cool app! While I was driving on the highway it said ""driving"". So many interesting words and full of ghosts outside, but not in our house pitifully.I will have to drag my tablet outside and have some fun listening to the words :DEdit: Ok, I have to edit my review. The app did detect a ghost inside. It said: Johnatan, sick, rest, care, lake, (At that time I stood up and moved away) Next words were move, come, hide and so on. At the same time, I heard two loud bangs in the bathtub.....spooky",5
It knew my mom's middle name and the radar detected my dog as a ghost! Will have to turn it on next time I am watching Dead Files or Ghost Adventures. Wonder if it can detect the ghosts from those shows!:-P,4
"Tried the app few minutes ago and it found many ghosts. Started showing words like, &quot;fall&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, &quot;stairs&quot;, and &quot;end&quot;. And while I was playing with this app I wasn't watching where I was going and I fell down the stairs and died. Now I'm a ghost writing this review!!",5
"Entertain for sure. Amazed as the first 10 words gave my grandmother's name and my father's name. Not typical names either, so unless can get through Ancestry.com was amazing.",4
Fun to play with.,3
"I downloaded Ghost Radar Classic (free)first. I got such a kick out of it that I splurged ($.99) and bought Ghost Radar. I have freaked out my 18-year-old daughter, and friends. Sometimes it spouts off words that make you go ""hummm."" For instance I had it running (on my KFire) one morning as I was getting ready for work. I walked out into the hallway where one of my cats was sitting and suddenly the radar said ""feed"". Yes indeed the cat was waiting for me to feed him.Most of the time it says things that don't make much sense but I get a kick out of it just the same. Yes, I am easily amused. :)",4
"This app is a fraud. It was unable to detect a known ghost living in my home for several decades.Back in the early 60s, a middle aged man was murdered in my home by a home intruder. This man's spirit has yet to leave the physical world for the spiritual as his murder has never been solved. He REFUSES to leave. This has been validated by several ghost hunting experts and I often hear him moaning about being hungry or tired.I tried using this app to detect his location but it wouldn't work. In fact, I knew he was in the bathroom at one point playing with the cat, but the app told me there was a ""reading"" in the kitchen.So, to sum it up, for those looking for something cheap to help them detect the ghosts living around us, look elsewhere.This app makes a mockery of the dead and the developers should be ashamed.",5
"Reviews are better than the app so it was worth the purchase price of zero..Got my money's worth. Gave it a 4 rating because the reviews were soooo funnyMy radar said I had a flat tongue and the police were going to act at the store. That is what I got from : police, store, act, tongue, flat. Love it...great timing for halloween. Don't let it creap you out it's just entertainment. Laugh a little. Keep the cool reviews commingled...oh...wait...incomming...message : Whatever you do give it your all...except when you are giving blood. hahahaha{^_-}",4
it detected several ghosts in my room.the words it heard are insanely ironic and scary. the word blood came up while I was watching Dexter. the word paragraph came up while I was writing an essay. the most scary thing is it said Carl and my best friend Carl died three days ago. weird,5
Obliterated my battery. After 5 minutes in a quiet room at work 35 words were heard. I guess my office must be haunted.,1
"I have proof that this app works, my parents and I are selling our house and we are deciding when to sell it. I checked to see if the ghost radar said anything and it said...  sell, it, later, your, house. This is no ly I swore never to ly again.",5
"Not for serious ghost hunters, but it is a cool little app for kids to have fun with. Of course it doesn't track real ghosts",3
I got this app because I believe in ghost soon I started seeing things I then found out this app is kinda like a wigi board game,1
u need a huge sense of humor to play this with this app.I will be listening to music and then it will either do a slow beet or says words when I'm not even on the app.,2
"I tried it, but did not like the lack of action.  I know it is fake, so why not make it fun fake?",2
"I definitely need this app as a watch dog on Halloween Day. If it detects the number of gremlins at my door hollering ""Trick or Treat"" then I'd be a firm believer of the paranormal. Be nice if it can create a video of the activity, that would at least provide a record of what happened. I encourage the devs to keep up the good work and investigate another app that will sense UFOs so I can start taking pictures and videos. Thanks Amazon!",5
i would love to use it but my tablet does not work right  when i run this program .. i have a craig tablet,1
"It's so silly its cool. I work with all women, so they are easily startled.  The first word was 'snake' which oddly enough there was a snake in my office a few months ago.4 stars since its a one-size-fits-all screen. Doesn't fill the screen in portrait mode on my Moto Atrix.  Landscape looks fine, and I like the 'stop radar on exit' feature.It's a fun app to rib people who believe in the paranormal.",4
"That being said, this application is a blast and it is fun to watch people fawn over it. If I knew earlier that all it took was a random word generator and a fake radar graphic to make people freak out as if I was some sort of medium with an Android phone... I would have written this app myself.  This is genius and really fun to play with! But anybody that thinks it's real and can actually talk to spirits? I would seriously question their sanity.",5
it said together forever my terrorist colony I was surprised id never EVER thought it'd say thatits scary but I. LOOOOOOOOVE a good scare,5
What a crazy app!!! Do I really wanna run this app when I'm alone? ?? Heck no! ! Wonder how many ghost are in a cemetery? ? FUN. APP!! THANKS,4
used the app and it worked but it invited ghosts into my home and they molested me. I am scared for my family be warned that ghosts may touch you in suggestive manners.,1
its stupid and pointless and ghost aren't even reel when you die you go to heaven or hell you cant go around the earth when your dead!!!! this is crape its totally stupid and its not real how would the developer get the app to sense all that stuff its crape lies!!! I mean seriously if your stupid enough to beloved this *omg it works I saw a ghost* -_- really?!...... get a life spud pickles and make something worth our time!!! God loves you :D,1
"So, a few minutes after I got this app I hopped in the shower. FYI, I'm the kind of person who sings in the shower. So, I'm singing Rock God by Selena Gomez and I get out. I was sceptical of ghosts and I thought this was a joke. so I mutter to myself,&quot; Yeah, I'll get some words from the other side,&quot;  I go to the Words column and I literally gasp with shock. it says,Please, Sing, louder. I'M LITERALLY GOING TO DIE. THIS THING IS STALKING ME. then, yesterday, this ghost named Chuck was calling me names. He called me Fatty, Loser, and the B word. I'm sad.-T.S.",5
After I loaded the program it ran very well not sure how accurate it is but quite a few times it was spot on,5
"I downloaded this app because the &quot;reviews&quot; had me LOL - LITERALLY!  OMG! Anyway, I open this app and its first word is &quot;soil.&quot;  I am watching the World Series BTW...",5
"Fun app to play with, uncanny how intuitive it can be",4
it said walk behind feathers ( I have a bird) so I did.I had a huge surprise because something tapped me on the shoulder.,4
what a waste of time. some woman's voice randomly says words. don't waste your time. App is junk. stupid. starts up and repeats dump words. it's not interesting. it is bull oney.,1
"I got this as the free app of the day from Amazon today.  I am glad I didn't pay any real money for this as this is like a ""Rick Roll"" type app which doesn't really do anything productive.  It was obviously meant to promote Sean Austin's music career.This app would be useful to people who want ideas to start their own music careers by picking a strange catchy name for your developer name and disguising it as something else such as a party gag type app.I agree with the many other reviewers that the reviews for this app are rather funny and entertaining.  Therefore, I am giving it 2 stars just because it gets people wanting to discuss their app purchases on Amazon.",2
its only shit and giggles for those who actually like the concept of ghosts. but it fails seeing how it still works on the kindle fire 1st gen lol...,1
This little app is great for creepy entertainment.  Does it work?  Who knows.  It's great for wandering around with a small group in creepy places.  Had a lot of fun with it.,4
"I was bored so I got the app, I don't believe in ghosts or anything I was just bored. its an ok app it shows weird patterns in your house and tells you there's a ghost there, its like your little brother on your phone. one thing I think would be cool to add is that at nighttime if someone turns it on make it so that it says that there are.like 30 ghosts right next to him",3
"I downloaded this for free, just in time for Halloween, for my kids to play with.  My daughter made fun, at first, but her younger brother loved it.  It struck his imagination, and he started ghost-hunting immediately.  After dark, even the teenager got in on the fun.The only problem I've found is that it KILLS YOUR BATTERY FAST.  The app says it basically uses all if your sensors, microphone, etc., so I'm sure that is why, but keep it in mind.I'm not saying it's a great ghost-hunting tool, but it's a cute little app that has given my kids hours of fun.",5
oh my gosh this thing totally works I think me and a ghost are becoming friends I mean real friends.,5
seems to function properly but does not display properly on larger screens .I can see and use everything but it is not scaling properly  try fill parent for your base layout.evo 3d,4
"I went to st Thomas and I went to the real blackbeards castle when I came home from the trip I was playing with the ghost radar and all of a sudden the word castle came up that really freaked me out!! And then a few minutes later the word structure came up that just freaked me out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I'm scared a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is real!!!!!! It's worth 1 dollar, if you get scared easy don't get this it's definitely real for sure not kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"I can't vouch 100% for this apps authenticity, but it is creepily accurate. I was picking up a few words that seemed meaningless. Then, jokingly, I said, &quot;what's your name?&quot; About five seconds later the word &quot;William&quot; came up. In another instance my little brother threw a can in the garbage can and the word &quot;score&quot; popped up. It creeped me out just a little. Love the app though and it's really neat",4
"This is awesome. ghosts are real. the last words it gave me were; hurried, Columbus, New York, directly, and audience. I was standing next to an Adam Dunn poster (white sox) and if you haven't noticed, those words fit in perfectly. even though Adam Dunn isn't dead, it could have also been another baseball player or someone related to him. This Is Real. don't believe the bad reveiws. Wait hang on, new words; look, up, danger....AAAAAAHHHHHHH!",5
Amazon should stop retards from rating the app they got for free. Funny how they're calling the app stupid and fake and give it 1 star when the author said it's for fun. idiots.,5
"I had the old version of this app. There have been a LOT of awesome improvements! Even tho I got the free day one, I'd still but it!",4
"nothing bad to say, just wouldn't waste time on this for kindle fire. fire has no gos,camera,or Mike, so it just spins, &amp; says a few random words like elephant gone mirror move. all unrelated it seems.",1
totally necessary. my periods are annoying and im always surprised when I get them even though I know when therye coming but not exactly and this helps...and @ahh...if a child sees this then u should tell them its none of their business. geez...why would u let a five year old use ur phone or kindle fire? geez...,5
"I've tried and tried and tried to get this thing to work, and it wont! It'll open and when I go to put in my info it completely closes! HATE IT!",1
"If I weren't sterile, I'm not sure I'd trust an Android app to keep my girlfriend from getting pregnant....get the picture?",5
This is one of the beter period and ovulation trackers that I have used. My best friend has been using this and she is now pregnant!! Very good job!,4
This app confused me and was not set up in a way I enjoyed. Feel similar? Get period tracker lite.,1
This is very helpful. I went off the pill to try and have a baby this tracks periods and ovulation times so i know when its best to try and make a little bundle of joy!!!,5
"tracks my period perfectly, even tells em when to expect my next one. great to have if you have a busy life and schedule",4
"I was unable to get this app to work properly. Every time I went to enter data, the application closed itself down. IF I CAN GET IT TO WORK, I will update this review...",1
"I was hoping this app was going to allow you to put in several dates, but it only allowed you to put in the date that you started. I was hoping to be able to put dates where cramping or spotting would occur, but that was not the case. This app is a standardized app for those who have the perfect cycle I guess.",1
"This game is not exactly what I was looking for in a word game.  I need more of a challenge.  It was okay, but really not exceptional.",3
"This is an okay game, it works like any anagrams game, very simple graphics, pretty easy to use and report scores. It's free and it works, no complaints",3
Rules are very important.  I tried several times to get the rules.  I played without rules and lost every time - big surprise.  I don't have the time nor the patience to go through this.  I just decided to send it back.  Sure would like to know how to play it though.  I love word games.,1
I really enjoyed these puzzles and you really had to have an open mind because alot of the time they were not what you thought they were and it made it exciting.  I wish more would come out like it.  I did all mine in a sitting and now they are done.,4
This is another word game that stimulates the brain.  It is very fast paced and challenges you to think faster.,5
Enjoyed playing w/my son.  Like any game that helps w/spelling & vocabulary. Why do I have to add more words?,4
"Since I have had this game, so many people have played it and want it.  It is really challenging and fun to play.",5
"I tried the app Word Frenzy on my Kindle Fire and I thought it was OK. It wasn't a game that kept me really interested or one I wanted to play just to waste some time. I have tried other word game apps that are better than this one. I didn't dislike the game, just didn't really like it either. I think what really gives me this opinion is the game doesn't have any eye catching graphics. Everything is different shades of green. It is free so try it and see if you like it, if you don't you aren't out any money!",3
not a great game. really basic. will be playing along then it just stops and says you are at a new level. but not sure how you got there.,2
I love majority of word game's. At 56 it keeps my mind sharp and it is amazing how many words are locked in your brain. It makes you think and you go as fast as you can to beat the clock and get a better score each time!,5
I absolutely love this game!  I still say it needs a larger dictionary but you have to be quick witted.  It's a great game and moves fast.  Highly recommended.,5
Nice game. It gets challenging at times but its fairly simple. Decent price. Decent. Game. If you love word games you'll like this one.,4
"I'm a word game fanatic and this game reminds me Text Twist, one of my favorites.  What's different is the letters change after a certain amount of time so while you're thinking of words with a set of letters, you have to switch gears fast for a different set.  Very entertaining for both kids and adults.",5
"When I did manage to get a word or two accepted, the game was over, and an ad would pop up for another app, and then I had to accept or push another ""button"" to go back to the game. The game seems to be enjoyable, but nothing would happen when I tried to select a letter. I tapped; I tried sliding the letter; I just pushed on the letter. It worked about 10% of the time.I tried the app twice. However, it was much more trouble than it was worth and I deleted it from my Kindle Fire...twice.",2
"I really enjoy this game. If you like challenging games, you will like this game. I wish the rounds were a little longer.",4
"I love word games, they help me keep this brain working. This is a fun game, and keeps me alert and on my toes.",5
"This app gives you a string of letters and about 30 seconds to make as many words as you can.  Then it moves on to another string of letters.  I find some sets easy, and others challenging, but I have always been able to think of at least one word for any set.  Even with the easy sets, I have to think fast to get a three-letter word, four-letter word, and so on, before it changes sets.It's great for when I'm not sure how much time I'll have to play because I can quit a game any time.  This is a must-have app for Wordies.  No problems loading on mySamsung Galaxy Tab, it doesn't hang up, and there are no intrusive ads.",5
"I don't like this game, it doesn't give me enough time to figure out the words before the letters change, and I am not sure I understand how the game really works.",1
Word Frenzy is offered for Free.  I'm glad I didn't have to pay any money to get it.  Its not one of the better games Amazon offers.,3
This is a great game for keeping the brain active.  It is a good way to get rid of other frustrations because it will give you new ones.  I love it.,4
Pretty sure it was free but even then it was not worth it to me. Way too simple and short really,1
I was looking for a app that was similar to the Scrabble game.  This is not it!  I did not care for this game did not like the timing.  It was challenging though if you are good at vocabulary origins.,3
"I play this game a lot. At the end it always said you did a great job even if you did not, which I think is kind of funny. I just like the game.",5
Not all that impressed and I am a big fan of word games. Needs something more to keep my attention. Maybe other word game fans will like the style because I didn't.,2
"It looks like fun, but I am not able to submit my answers, have to wait for the &#34;time&#34; to submit it.",2
"The only thing wrong is that it doesn't always give you a choice to go to the next level (you have to End first). As a possible improvement, it would be nice to know somehow what the correct 6 letter word was.  You have a limited time (30 sec or so) to guess 3, 4, 5, and 6 letter words.  Then you get new letters.  We enjoy this game a lot!",4
"love playing this game, making words out of random letters keeps one on their toes.This was another free game from amazonthanks folks",5
This game is lots of fun and very challenging. I would highly recommend it for hours of entertainment and mind stimulating exercise.,4
"Word frenzy really helps improve on your vocabulary.  Thought I was a whiz kid with fast paced word scramble games but this one is great...the nice thing is that you can check back and find out what words you could have used and their meaning...for next time, perhaps?",3
Love it!I like word games. I hope that wordzup becomes available.I didn't think I would like this one;it is now one my favorites.,4
"I originally picked it out for my grandson, but it is a bit too advanced for him, but I got addicted after trying it out and will play game after game.",4
Great fun and easy to win large amounts if you increase the bet and play more lines......Kids like it too,5
I like all of the slots and video poker games. It lets me play and don't have to worry about losing money like inthe casino. Or at least not as much!,5
It's an OK game but probably not one I will play often. It's good for when you just need to waste a few minutes while standing in line somewhere.,3
"While the name suggests a simple application, the dev did (is doing?)  a good job. Very configurable, with different lines and coin requirements, and multiple near complete themes. I say near complete because there is only one set of sounds. The dev may be intending to add more as there is a custom theme option which allows you mix and match machines, symbols, and sounds.The graphics are done pretty old for the machine, symbols done much better. The game runs very stable and smoothly.",3
I like this game.  It is fun to play and cheaper than going to the casino  I would recommend to anyone who like to play the slots,5
"very simple but very funny,love to play this slot and i will recomand to everyone aleast to try it and i am sure u will like it",5
"It has very good sound effects and is fun to play, just when I think I will run out of money, I've won something that keeps the action going. Not a fancy slot machine, but it works fine in my Kindle Fire.",3
This was a reasonable purchase. The product performed as described and the price was adequate. I recommend the purchase to everyone who understands the details. Hate the ads,4
This is another really easy game to play. I enjoy paying tis gme while takng chemo. I wuld also recommendd thi game to everyone.,3
"ANOTHER BORING SLOT IT IS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR  I HAVE DELETED THIS GAME LIKE I HAD DONE SOME OF THE OTHER ONES, WHEN IT'S FREE YOU KNOW IT WON'T BE THAT GREAT",2
The name fits the game.  It is too simplistic.  I probably would not buy it if it were for sale.,3
Not much to this game as would explain why I don't play it very much. Thought it would be so much more,3
OK and fun once in a while but becomes boaring. Do play from time to time.Will keep it on my Kindle Fire for down times.,3
Very boring.  Air head game.  No points to play with last long.  Deleted after 2 days. Nothing to enjoy about it.  No excitement,1
"This was a free download I got three phones ago. I don't remember it at all. As it would be unfair to praise or damn this, I gave it a 3 star rating, mostly to get Amazon to stop spamming me to rate this. Go by the ratings and comments of anybody else. It is free, so how bad can it be?",3
Thanks.  I often want to convert something or other.  This will keep me from having to Google the answer.  It is nice.,4
This is a great tool for any nurse/nursing student who needs to convert between different systems in order to give proper doses of medications to patients. FREE makes it even better!,5
got this for the information that I wasn't taught as a child.. I use it often when needing some good advice.,3
"i love this application and have been using it to convert many units of measure, weights and measurements.  just try it.",5
"This game is very fun and a good game to play during your free time...if you haven't already passed it! Really to me, that is the only bad thing I love the game but there is really short! But I would download it because its free and fun! I hope they make a second one though..that's longer!",3
"game is great but way too short. there are only 10 levels. i don't see that this is a demo, and there is no paid version. beat the game in an hour. uninstalling :-(",3
"I love this game. Like others have said, I wish it was longer. I would pay for a longer version.",5
"Does not work with Motorola Droid X2. Tried numerous times and between system lockups, reboots and processor/ battery over heats, had to finally remove.",1
I tried the app because my boys wanted it.  They played it for about 20 minutes before getting tired of it.  I played it for about 10 minutes and realized how little I was enjoying it.,2
"If you think you're a great multitasker, this game might give you a challenge.  Simple in over all design, your job is to keep track of the various wants of the customers, sending them to the appropriate place as quickly as possible.  The fast you cue them up, the higher your score.  Each level adds complexity with new activities, faster influx of customers, and multiple wants.  Thrown in there is the customer whose needs change part way through (gotta potty!)  Control is simple, just point to select the customer and then where they are to go.  As easy as that sounds, I found that often my input was missed, or selected the wrong item/customer due to multiple objects being close to one another.  The game starts off slow but pick up speed pretty quick.  Graphics are ok, nothing fabulous, but the whole thing works well.  The animations of the customers doing the many activities is funny, though watching them too long can cost you some points.  Sound and music match the graphics, tying the whole game together.",4
"I finished all 10 levels very quickly. It's fun, I just wish it had more to it. As the levels progressed it became more difficult not to accidentally select the wrong pirate, other than that it was easy and fun to play.",4
pretty cute game and funny too. i enjoyed the different things that were added the more levels you passed. overall real cute.,4
"Cute, fun little game. Not enough levels, but it was free, so I can't complain. Not for anyone who hates pirates & not for alcoholics.",4
"geez, how many &quot;tell the idiot customers what do do or they get mad&quot; games can they make? lame game, I am so glad I didn't pay for it.",2
"i have a pandigital supernova with an 8 inch screen.  this and all apps should have an autofit option.  i loved playing it, but as you progress in the game, you get more stations.  they don't fit on my screen.  i fail levels because i can't touch them.....otherwise i would give it 5 stars.",2
"Not optimized for Kindle Fire? The menu is not aligned correctly. Will have one more star when optimized.Cute graphics, simple gameplay, kind of short",3
"Some apps consider a Samsung Galaxy Tab to be a an Android phone and some don't.  This app doesn't.  I installed, tested a few functions then uninstalled it almost immediately.",2
"great app much better from the &#34;stock&#34; kindle task manager.  Easy to use for beginner to novice, in normal mode,  has an expert mode that will def appeal to the more tech advanced.",4
it gives multiple options for methods of closing applications. I like that the long method brings you to the actual android force close menu. I typically do not like task managers but after downloading words with friends I need to kill that app because it drains my battery,5
This product showed up on my home page of my droid phone and when I click on it it says that it closed 17 programs. Then I click on it right after and it says it closed 3 or 5 or 7 and so on and so on... I didn't know this product was from Amazon. At least now I know who I can call to have it removed or fixed. I can't seem to get Verizon to fix the phone which has not worked right since I got it.,1
I love this app it allwos me to organize delete and move all my apps and it doesn't delete my sprint nascar app that I really need I don't know what I would do without my sprint nascar app,4
